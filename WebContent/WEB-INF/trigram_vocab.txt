646 admit that i
646 perfect place for
646 base on my
645 gave us the
645 and cheese is

572 of the show
572 drink and appetizer
572 pleasant surprise the
572 with a spicy
572 very good for

572 you might have
572 fish n chip
572 willing to give
571 sauce which was
571 pad thailand is
571 hard to eat
571 and yes i

571 ask for my
571 for an extra
571 and flavorful i
571 the consistency of
571 find a spot
571 was enough for
571 my favorite of
571 definitely not worth
571 a chain restaurant
571 for pick up

538 i am really
538 of the wait
538 with the staff

538 just for that
538 the restaurant that
538 when i eat
538 the chocolate cake

538 that had been
538 way it s
538 dine area is
538 in the u
538 so many good
537 take a bite
537 but the rest
537 a round of
537 to talk about
537 place is one
537 where i can
537 very nice i
537 it to my
537 wasn t overly
537 s definitely worth
537 however the service
537 have ever seen
537 my sandwich was
537 they are pretty
537 a shot of
537 glad to have
537 absolutely delicious i
537 wash it down
537 i do wish
537 those place that
537 ve had and
537 we each had
537 huge selection of
537 because i think
537 each other and
537 china restaurant in
536 said that they
536 get it again
536 my favorite thailand
536 also didn t
536 the bar it
536 food and this
536 to get one
536 i just went
536 rice it was
536 better than that
536 stop by the
536 but it still
536 they will be
536 quality of their
536 i must have
536 being in the
536 time i ate
536 the sauce they
536 at least twice
536 top notch the
536 t able to
536 is so nice

535 to share a
535 is simple and
535 the dessert were
535 when i ve

534 and ready to
534 to say is
534 wait an hour
534 able to order
534 crab cake and
534 where i was
534 so many great
534 straight out of

534 the mistake of
534 place to enjoy
534 of the chef
534 away from this
534 i will admit
534 perfect balance of
534 t taste the
534 but my husband
534 week and i
534 the appetizer were
534 the list of
534 the wait and
534 you shouldn t
534 i think its
534 can t make
534 and then a
534 the way you
533 but no one
533 out from the
533 but the waiter
533 had the chance
533 the way of
533 soup or salad
533 when i order
533 time to come
533 burg and i
533 dinner and i
533 table we were
533 lot of variety
533 could have made
533 to be too
533 i expect more

253 ask for something
253 enough for my
253 food took forever
253 and efficient and
253 and even if
253 and delicious but
253 owner are very
253 place to me
253 for the pork
253 were light and
253 menu is quite
253 it s rare
253 get over it
253 about the pizza
253 take a bit
253 from the old
253 person but i
253 main reason i
253 little of everything
253 is with the
253 was a place
253 to eat lunch
253 then we wait
253 with a creamy
253 and will probably
253 what more do
253 make the drive
253 and side of
253 serve it to
253 the last bite
253 i dream about
253 lamb and beef
253 fine but nothing
253 lunch and we
253 here and have
253 this one and
253 good price i
253 the fry tofu
253 taste but it
253 helpful and attentive
253 flavorful and not
253 fry with the
253 these were the
253 is you can
253 take long to
253 almost all the
253 got home i
253 me out of
253 up to me
253 it as it
253 drink as well
253 them another shot
253 efficient and friendly
253 we enjoy a
253 seating is a
253 out of stars
253 of the crowd
253 on the sauce
253 side for the
253 ambiance and service
253 but only if
253 from scratch and

247 menu and have
247 and the environment
247 is the atmosphere
247 we decided we

247 decor is really
247 base on other
247 they serve is
247 turn out it

180 dinner i m
180 good way i
180 and nothing special
180 amazing i also

180 bean on the
180 cheese pizza and
180 was a one
180 this one but

176 a small hole
176 not many people
176 it was damn
176 they have and
176 cheese sandwich and
176 the parking was
176 but they should
176 the price my
176 good no complaint

176 been living in
176 away at the
176 restaurant in cleveland

176 all they had
176 meat but it
176 explore the menu
176 was never a
176 cook the meat
176 after that it
176 the restroom and
176 he was on
176 it s important
176 but since they

141 and variety of
141 as the waitress

120 little hidden gem
120 s time for
120 on tap they

120 kind of spicy
120 they re definitely
120 after check out

120 iceberg lettuce and
120 brunch it was
120 meat didn t
120 m the only
120 and the salt
120 its a pretty
120 to have for
120 oil and garlic
120 place was go
120 of my mind
120 i am too
120 just as bad
120 start to go
120 that a few
120 maybe this place
120 s serve in
120 know some people
120 yes i would
120 something different the
120 better food at
120 so great and
120 out this restaurant
120 the veggie combo
120 be making a
120 and exactly what
120 is nothing fancy

120 open late on
120 a bit about
120 again the only
120 on certain days

120 up the table
120 hard time choose
120 and a better
120 do feel like
120 it is with
120 with the sausage
120 the rice to

119 over it was
119 the coffee i
119 pricey if you

119 of the spectrum
119 spicy with a
119 a small area
119 the manager s
119 can be and
119 great time we
119 should have left
119 the server just
119 out to greet
119 beef stew and
119 get the regular
119 of the roast
119 until i went
119 would ask for
119 except it was
119 choice of topping
119 i remember my
119 business trip to
119 our first course
119 better than many
119 for you in
119 night i think
119 walk up the
119 a satisfying meal
119 was tender the
119 the floor the
119 or so minutes
119 little sweet for
119 only came here
119 bacon and avocado
119 can get loud
119 been twice now
119 waitstaff was very
119 the biggest problem
119 sausage it was
119 flavor and were
119 on the rib
119 are hungry and
119 as hell and
119 the next course
119 add on the
119 is next door
119 hour or two
119 of the back
119 well which was
119 to split and
119 so full i
119 of the past
119 salad and an
119 back every time
119 find a nice
119 of their pasta
119 that give it
119 dip sauce they
119 full but i
119 pork was so
119 accommodating and friendly
119 fry egg rolls
119 are small than
119 the kitchen with
119 was close by
119 price tag i
119 match the price
119 hard and the
119 go at the
119 a little bore
119 or not they
119 only had their
119 pork sandwich the
119 waiter are very
119 the beginning but
119 a corner of
119 the coconut soup
119 day to day
119 the couple that
119 sandwich to be
119 is also super
119 although it wasn
119 t expect this
119 mexico place i
119 was cut into
119 supposed to eat
119 but i suspect
119 ever since it
119 i definitely like
119 call the manager
119 seat yourself and
119 very good all
119 are some things
119 eat i would
119 place again i

119 waitress seem to
119 this is worth
119 delicious it had
119 it was chicken

103 to go their
103 instead of making
103 bowl of chili
103 pay for an

103 so many flavor
103 bread which i
103 with the idea
103 but the bacon
103 oh my the

103 thinking about that
103 reason to be
103 that we wouldn
103 meal was so
103 go back or
103 of the pancake
103 with the tuna
103 for we had
103 of fish in
103 nice and a
103 cuisine in the
103 great local place

90 this one because
90 went back i
90 before heading home

90 is the sweet
90 was cool i
90 because she didn
90 the bbq and
90 was very thick
90 was thinking about
90 to come from
90 friendly service but
90 was essentially a
90 they are way
90 base on its
90 can be loud
90 in a world
90 moist and not
90 get in to
90 fluffy and delicious

90 i get some
90 st louis it
90 in cleveland for
90 call to see
90 savory and the
90 france toast that
90 the walnut shrimp

60 was price at
60 and old fashion
60 give a better
60 she s very
60 your money the
60 but the stuff
60 like deep fry
60 that made up
60 biggest disappointment was
60 i ordered they
60 roll in the
60 fun and casual
60 just expect a
60 to check my
60 evening with my
60 restaurant the first
60 be completely honest
60 lox of bagel
60 was pretty easy
60 decided to pass
60 bring up the
60 not fan of
60 stuff but it
60 seat along the
60 not conducive to
60 seem like one
60 everything that you
60 a new breakfast
60 her hand and
60 or five times
60 and flavor was
60 better than we
60 show up about
