If you're vegetarian or vegan, you'll love Sen Yai Sen Lek's options, but be a little cautious because several staff members consider fish sauce to be vegetarian. I've received 'vegan' dishes with egg in it before, too.The Taohoo Tod (tofu with a peanut cilantro chili sauce) is vegan, and the Pad Thai Goong is vegan if you tell them: \"vegan with (tofu or mock duck), no egg, no fish sauce.\" Both are amazingly delicious, and pro tip: save the peanut cilantro chili sauce and add the remainder to the pad thai. It sounds like the kitchen has a separate vegan sauce and takes it seriously, but they're not great at communication about it: the menu doesn't have marked vegan options, the staff isn't great about knowing what is and isn't vegan, and to-go orders don't always have 'vegan' written on them.

Let me just start by saying that I've recently becoming addicted to Thai food. I've just moved away from Portland, where there were at least 12 really good Thai places within three miles of my house. After putting some Pad Thai or Pad Se Ew in my mouth no less than 5 times a week for nine months, my only experience in the Midwest has been a less than average one at a place in Grand Forks, North Dakota.Before making the four and a half hour (or 40 year) trip from Crookston to Minneapolis I did some searching and found Sen Yai Sen Lek on Yelp. I was excited. We arrived in town and met up with my wife's friend. She suggested we go to a bar, but I threatened to smack her if we didn't get some Thai food stat. She agreed and we were on our way. I began to get nervous because I wasn't very hungry (had stopped at a buffet on the way down and gotten full on some weird \"food\") but a big fat doobie of some Minneapolis brickweed quickly set me stomach a-rumblin.I was torn by their ambiance. The place, although my memory fails me on specifics, was strangely decorated and most of the staff was white which tends to make me nervous. Still, I was impressed when I sat down and glanced their great beer selection (something of a rarity at Thai joints) and noticed the placcard on the table explaining that they get all their meat and veggies from local sustainable sources. The waiter, a smiling polite young man, quickly came over and took our order. For an appetizer we ordered some chicken satay, which came out promptly and was some of the best I ever had. Then we ordered dinner.I got the Pad Se Ew (which I noticed was made in the traditional way, without stupid carrots), my wife went with the staple Pad Se Ew, and her friend got something with skinny noodles and pork that the waiter recommended. The food was delivered, I took a sample bite, offered some to my dining mates, and then scarfed the entire plate down in less than five minutes. It was so good (possibly the best I ever had) \u00a0that I considered ordering another plate, but was talked out of it by my wife. The Pad Thai that my wife ordered (and the leftovers that I also devoured) was top of the line, and the pork dish ordered by her friend was delightful.We hung around the place for about forty five minutes after we finished eating (my wife and her friend hadn't seen each other in over eight years) and weren't made to feel like we should leave. Then, after leaving we were chased down the street by the waiter; we had forgotten our leftovers. As someone who forgets his leftovers more often than not, this was quite a remarkable occurrence.My only complain was the spice level; I tend to like things so hot that my anus bleeds the next morning and have built up quite a tolerance over the past few years. Most Thai places ask you for your desired spice level, but the waiter here seemed confused when I asked him to make it extra spicy. It came out with less heat than cereal, but he did give me a tray of spices and I was able to rectify the situation.I don't know if I'll ever be back in Minneapolis (it's kind of in the middle of nowhere) but if I do, I know what my first stop will be.", "Date": "2013-06-20", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Ben S.", "ReviewID": "PS6625g7T98bI-15AKuPkQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good Thai food in a Minneapolis suburb--who'd have thunk?!

It keeps getting better each time I go back and is one of only a handful of Thai restaurants that I've been to in the US that accurately recreates the flavors I encountered regularly in Thailand itself.First the foremost, this is probably one of only a couple Thai restaurants in the Twin Cities where you can be guaranteed to get a meal without fish sauce, without shrimp paste and without any other animal product. The staff and owners here understand and respect veganism and go to great lengths to make sure we are accommodated, and in fine style, I might add (separate veg*n menu, numerous veg*n appetizers, entrees and desserts, and friendly staff that always finds answers to your questions).Secondly the food here is simply excellent. The curries and stir-frys are robust and complex and never feel watered down or simplified like at practically every other Thai restaurant in the Twin Cities (I'm looking at you, Tum Rup Thai and your Uptown clones). Too often does Thai food get turned into either piddling pad thai or soy sauce stir-frys over white rice; at Sen Yai, on the other hand, you'll get a dish loaded with herbs, a multitude of Thai chilis, and tricky variations of from-scratch, hard-to-make curry pastes. You never get the sense that Sen Yai takes shortcuts in its preparation.Third, Sen Yai Sen Lek really listens to its customers and makes changes quickly. The first time I went they didn't have a separate veg*n menu. The second time they did have a veg*n menu, though my noodle dish seemed a little bland. When I came back the third time my next dish was wonderfully spicy and hearty. The fourth time I went they didn't have brown rice but their green curry with tofu was still stunning and substantial in its spice levels and overall heft. Finally, the latest time I went, the panang curry with mock duck ($11.95) was fragrant, rich, and now came with brown rice.I also had a dessert, black beans with sticky rice and coconut milk ($4.95) which really hit the spot. You'll often see sticky rice with mango or banana, but rarely do you see unusual ingredients such as black beans. In another testament to Sen Yai Sen Lek's quality and attention-to-detail, the dessert came with a little twig of mint leaves. This doesn't sound like much, but it's something I have never seen at any other Thai restaurant, and it added that much more flavor, complexity and interest to the dessert.Finally, this is a great place either for a quick, affordable lunch (lunch specials are around $8-9), or an intimate, extended dinner date. They have a good selection of beer and wine and the interior decoration is warm and inviting.

Since Sen Yai seems to have a reputation of being authentic, I thought the pad gra pow was going to be goooooood. So with blind excitement, I ate my pad gra pow, that is until a twig nearly jabbed my gum off my tooth. In my dish were a bunch of other twigs like you'd find in potting soil and a mini holy basil plant, minus the roots. Just the holy basil leaves would have made the dish authentic enough for me. Well, that was last year and the place still gets good reviews and good press, so my dish then must have been a fluke, right?This time around, the dish was heavy on the soy sauce/fish sauce so I had to adjust the flavor with sugar. Luckily, the dish was mostly leaves with the exception of one huge stem with flowers. No twigs, though! No twigs. I've determined the pad thai here is awful. First time it was white noodles with barely registering flavor and shrimp so salty it tasted like it was soaked in salt water. This time the noodles were dark and salty. In both instances, I was questioning, \"Where is the tamarind and sugar?\" The servers may say that's what the spice tray is for, but personally I'm not enthused about constantly adjusting the flavor of my dish. Just means to me, the restaurant doesn't have to be consistent with its cooking. The real bright spot was the spring rolls. \u00a0It came out hot, like singe the roof of your mouth hot.

All pluses.But I can't bear eating Thai food that is just so disappointingly mediocre. I have to believe that this place gets its solid 4-star cumulative rating because of a captive audience. That is, it's the only Thai to be found in this neck of the woods and Thai food is extremely craveable. Nothing else hits that deeply savory spot, salty, sweet, sour, and spicy all at the same time.But that's the problem with the food here. It rarely hits all those notes with any clarity or consistency. Sometimes it doesn't even hit any of them.Almost every component is house-made and they don't rely on commercial mixes or pastes, the servers have told me. I'm all for that...except SYSL's food never has that brightness of flavor that I associate with Thai cuisines. It's always muted by a sort of muddiness. In the case of dishes where the stock/broth is the backbone of the dish, the broth always tastes like they let it boil and didn't skim enough when they were making the base stock. I've made this mistake at home in my own kitchen and I don't know if it's true for SYSL but that's the flavor I recognize it as. Muddiness is something you just can't cover up. It's a problem with the foundation.The other issue is the tray of seasonings and chilies they bring to the table. I'm willing to fine-tune and tweak seasonings to my taste at the table but what I cannot do is repair the lack of proper seasoning that should occur at every stage of cooking. There is no way to compensate for this after a dish is already cooked. Seasoning added at the table never tastes as fully integrated as seasoning that occurs in the kitchen. \u00a0We've been here three times since they opened two years ago and have tried different dishes each time but have been so disappointed \u00a0that unless I'm alerted to some big sea change in the kitchen, I can't see myself going back.", "Date": "2010-08-20", "Author_Location": "Minneapolis, MN"}, {"Author": "Catherine F.", "ReviewID": "HE7jhzPw2XYYqmYsvzEVbg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I enjoyed this restaurant thoroughly. \u00a0I lived in Thailand for a year, and I would say this restaurant separates itself from many other Thai restaurants in the U.S.. \u00a0While I do like some other Thai restaurants in the cities, Sen Yai seems to put more thought and care into their dishes overall. \u00a0 I ordered one of the curries of the day--green curry with beef. \u00a0Initially, I didn't like the idea that you couldn't choose your own meat for the curry of the day. \u00a0However, the curry had a perfect combination of salty and spicy flavor that really worked. \u00a0You could tell that the curry had been cooking all day. \u00a0I think the care they put into dishes like this is where other restaurants fall short and are inconsistent. \u00a0I also tried the Laab Gai and the Khao Soi, both of which were very good. \u00a0I must admit that I didn't have any Khao Soi in Thailand, so I can't comment on its authenticity. \u00a0The mango sticky rice made an excellent dessert. \u00a0I liked the fried spring rolls and enjoyed the wrapping. \u00a0They are a bit thicker than many spring rolls I've had, which I don't see as a bad thing.The service I received was very friendly and extremely fast. \u00a0I was there on the early side for dinner, so perhaps that changes during the rush times. \u00a0Overall, I appreciate Sen Yai's desire to be different from the rest and authentic, and I think they do it well. \u00a0I will be back so that I can (hopefully) have the same experience again.", "Date": "2011-01-18", "Author_Location": "Minneapolis, MN"}, {"Author": "Zac S.", "ReviewID": "d1IbolfhxQG5coOt7d2Rdw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It isn't often that I come to this neck of the woods (not nearly often enough).I had a meeting (unemployment code for coffee with a friend) and brought my lunch, so when we were done chatting and with coffee and she kicked me outta her house, I came to Central Ave to check thing out.It ws 50/50 if I would eat the salad I brought. \u00a0I parked in front of Holy Land, where they luckily have camel liver on sale, and funny enough, we ate our last camel liver last night!So I ate my salad (nicely prepared, I might add) and went inside.After the bagger helped me load my backseat full of liver, I saw Sen Yai Sen Lek across the street. \u00a0Hmmmmmm.....Looks good. \u00a0Wife calls. \u00a0We chat. \u00a0I tell her where I was. \u00a0She told me that heavytable.com just posted something about SYSL this morning! \u00a0(turns out to be a bit of a confusion there, because when I looked it up, it wasn't what I thought. \u00a0Just a mention. \u00a0Not one of their full blown articles they are so good at putting up there, daily.)So I go in to see a menu, get seated, and ordered the Pad Bpai Gra Pow, which is pronounced padbpaigrapwoawoedi which, \u00a0as you can tell from the name, has pork and rice and red chili in it.It was awesome. \u00a0The tray of \"spices\" which includes sugar (is that really a spice, or is it just one of those things that is just always there, like air?) wasn't even necessary.I am coming back.

I'm not sure what this means, but she didn't really like it, but I thought it was pretty good. First, I liked the place because it doesn't look like a typical Thai restaurant. Most Thai places that I have been to are crowded and dark with gobs of Asian artifacts littered about the place. This is a bright space with high ceilings and vibrant colors. The restaurant has a warm welcoming feel and would be a good place to have a long dinner and conversation with friends over wine. I ordered the Red Chicken Curry, at $15, it was the most expensive item on the menu and my girlfriend ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai ($13). We also both ordered hot tea. They bring out hot water and 6 different teas to choose from. I had a particularly aromatic jasmine tea that pleasantly jolted the senses. I thought that the curry was great, it came with sticky rice, several deep fried accouterments, and a thin mini omelet. The dishes are served mild and the waitress will bring several spices, of varying degrees of heat. There is a mild sugary spice, a pepper spice, a jalapeno spice and a delicious fish sauce with hot peppers. I'm not usually a fish sauce fan, but the waitress recommended it and I can vouch that it was a great mix of sweet and spicy. The reason that I didn't give this place four stars was that my girlfriend didn't like the Pad Thai. She usually loves Thai food, and she though the food was slightly below average. I tasted her meal and agree that I've had better. There are too many noodles and not enough of whatever else makes up Pad Thai.

Great for holding babies and scarfing spring rolls. The friends knew the owner, and we were very well looked-after. I tried an array of different appetizers, which were for the most part quite tasty. The tofu satay with peanut sauce was a highlight, as was the green papaya salad served with sticky rice. It was really tart but the rice balanced it out nicely. My entree was Pad See Iew, and I loved it. Wide egg noodles with egg, chicken and Chinese broccoli, in a sweet soy sauce. Sweet, salty, awesome. Also, big portions. I also had the pleasure of trying Thai iced tea, my new favorite drink. I was skeptical at first, mostly due to its burnt orange color, but the first sip won me over. I am now ordering this whenever I get Thai. The menu emphasizes the restaurant's commitment to authentic preparation and sourcing ingredients locally, which is great. There are a number of veggie/vegan dishes plus many others that can be made so upon request. The decor is sparse - not the chock full of junk type vibe that you typically see, but it almost feels too barren. Definitely no need to dress up. The main dining room has plentiful seating, and there is a separate space for parties / additional seating with a bar.

So when we started going up to Eastside Co-op to pick up our CSA and discovered just how close Sen Yai Sen Lek was, my heart overflowed with joy. And possibly sesame oil.We went on a particularly steamy Wednesday night, partially to beat the heat, partially to pick up our CSA. When I got there, there were a few tables already occupied, but it was a nice atmosphere and figured it would be an enjoyable wait while my husband bussed on down. Beyond the five minutes it took for the hostess to notice me and the young family there before me, I was still optimistic.I got a seat and was promptly abandoned by my server. I'll cut the story short by saying that it took me over 20 minutes from the time I was seated until I got my first bottle of beer. It was not busy, there were no demanding tables, it seriously took that long for her to come over, figure out what I wanted, open a bottle of beer, and come back. My husband had a similar experience when he finally arrived.The food, to its credit, did come out very quickly and the portion sizes were fair. However, I was not blown away. I ordered the Ba Mee Haeng (BBQ pork, lettuce, garlic, egg noodles) as a soup and it wasn't really anything all that different from Roat Osha or Sawadtee. The fried spring rolls were nice, but tasted heavily of dirty grease and came with a meek little dipping sauce. My husband ordered the marinated steak salad and enjoyed it, but it failed to really stand out and wow either of us.My soup was getting spicy and we were out of not only beers, but water. Our waitress was literally nowhere to be seen - it's like she went on break for 45 minutes and didn't put anyone else on our section. I finally managed to flag down another server, asking for more water and he politely informed me that he wasn't our server, but out of the deep generosity of his heart walked the 10 steps to the server station and mustered up another glass of water. So we finished dinner and waited at least another 15 minutes with empty glasses and dirty plates before another server came by to take them. I asked him for the check, not knowing where our server could have gone to. He brought it, but reminded me that he wasn't actually our server. Our original waitress finally came by as I was finishing out the receipt. I still feel stupid for actually giving them 15%.\"Okay, not such a great experience,\" my husband mused, \"but let's at least go to the bar and have one more drink because it's 1 million degrees Farenheit out there.\" We sauntered over and our waitress from before asked if we wanted to be seated, as if she had never seen us before.

Honestly, I didn't really like it, but it's just something that I didn't care for. The dish was prepared and presented well, just not my thing.

I was surprised at the amount of chicken they gave me. It was way more than the typical 3 chunks I've come to expect. I love fungus so I could have used more mushrooms in the dish but that's me being picky. The only thing I think I can complain about is the hint of anise, or something similar, that I tasted. It might be my least favorite seasoning. While it didn't ruin the dish for me by any means it was really unexpected. Not entirely unpleasant but a little bit. Again, that's a personal thing though.

It was a tad bland in the flavor department, but I fixed that real quickly with the array of sauces they leave on the table. The chili sauce gave it the nice kick that I needed. And as with any Thai food restaurant, get a Thai Iced Tea. Always a necessity for me. And for dessert, the mango on coconut sticky rice is always a crowd pleaser.Cons: The server wasn't stellar, but was still semi-attentive. Parking is a pain in the butt, but if you can find a spot on the street from 1-5 blocks away - totally worth it. And the chopsticks; bring your own! They provide the cheap-o sticks and I've managed to get the yucky splinter filled ones both times I've been here.

I too am now hooked, and Sen Yai Sen Lek has become my go-to spot for Thai food in Minneapolis. The food is just delicious. Their menu offers a great variety of authentic Thai food- sticky rice dishes, noodle dishes and curries. If you're in the mood for an incredibly flavorful and satisfying noodle dish, try the Pad Kee Mao or the Khao Soi - you can't go wrong with either one. For appetizers, I've had the Po Pia Tod (fried spring rolls), Po Pia Sod (fresh spring rolls) and Gai Satay - it's all good. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Po Pia Tod weren't saturated with grease as you might find with fried spring rolls at other restaurants. \u00a0 The prices are reasonable considering you'll probably have leftovers from almost any main dish you order. They also offer a discount if you come in for lunch within a week after you've dined here for dinner (just show your receipt). One thing that I really love about this place, that sets it apart from other Thai restaurants, is that nearly everything they serve is sourced locally (including beer and soda). Also, the service here is great - the waiters are very helpful, attentive, and always have great recommendations for new things to try on the menu. The atmosphere is quaint, casual and relatively quiet. Sen Yai Sen Lek is an excellent option for Thai food lovers in Minneapolis.

I am going back and forth about giving this place 3 or 4 stars. Here's my dilemma, folks. I would give the restaurant, itself, 5 stars. The food was amazing and plentiful for the price. My co-worker and I started out with a fried spring roll appetizer. It was amazing!!!! The meat and veggies were seasoned and delicious, very fresh. The sweet and spicy dipping sauce was nom-nom-nom-alicious. We ordered a Cane Cola to drink with our meals which was also very sweet and satisfying. It's made with real cane sugar, so it has a nice sweet flavor, but it's not syrupy and as acidic as you often get with regular colas. I ordered the special for the evening, which was chicken curry for $15. I received a bowl full of heaven!!!! The chicken curry had good cuts of chicken and an array of fresh veggies. The curry was smokin' hot spicy, just the way I like it. I also was brought a plate with my rice, a side salad, and a thai omelet. The salad was carrot strands, sprouts, and some spinach leaves. The thai omelet was delicious!!! I've never had one before. The presentation was great and the food tasted so so so good. The restaurant is really cute. It's colorful and modern looking. The walls are painted in bright primary colors and there are colorful paper cranes hanging throughout the place. The art on the wall is appealing and modern. It doesn't have the feel of a traditional thai restaurant, which I thought was a refreshing change. The space echos quite a bit, however. There was a gathering of a gaggle of middle aged women that we gossiping loudly in our proximity and I found it to be a bit overwhelming of our dinner conversation. I think the concrete walls of this place kind of intensified the drunken screeching of the 40-somethings. Eh, annoying. But they seemed to be having an good time, which was cool. So, sounds good so far, right? Yup. Everything would have been totally great, buuuuuut.. . . . Our waiter was a little too inattentive. My friend and I arrived around 7:15pm. We didn't get seated until about 7:30pm. Our orders were taken promptly enough, and we received our beverages and appetizers in a timely fashion. But then we didn't get our main dishes for about 40 minutes after we had our appetizers. Our waiter graciously apologized and said it was all his fault and then he told us that \"desert is on me, ladies\". Which, I was like \"hell yeah!!\". Our food was brought to us hot, so atleast it didn't sit there at the serving station getting cold while he ran around and entertained the table full of moms. Then after we got our food, we ate all that we could and decided to take the rest home. Upon completing the eating, we ended up waiting another half hour for our waiter to bring us our tab and some to-go boxes. He brought us the desert menu and told us to pick something out, which we did, and then after having done so, he brought us our tab. Much to our surprise, he charged us for our deserts that were supposed to be \"on him\". My co-worker brought it up and he said that he could take ONE of them off. So. . .I was kind of turned off by that. I wouldn't have ordered one if I knew I'd have to pay for it because me and my co-worker were requesting them \"to go\" anyway. So, whatever, I guess it is what it is. But after we paid, we sat at our booth and waited another 20 minutes to get our desert. What the hell?? It was ice cream and fried bananas!!! By this time, I was just getting irked. They weren't toooooo incredibly busy, but it appeared that they only had 3 waiters/waitresses and a bus boy working on the dining floor. The \"Mom's Night Out\" table had 10 women at it, so I understand that they might demand a little more man power, but I was kind of peeved by the end of it all, excuses or not. Our waiter was incredibly charming and charismatic, so he kind of gets away with it with me. Anytime I'd get annoyed with his lack of attention to our table, he'd swing by and schmooze us a little and I'd get all googly-eyed and stupefied. So, atleast he has that going for him. Total time spent at Sen Yai Sen Lek: A little over 2 hours. I would say that we spent an hour or so of that time WAITING for stuff. Not cool. But since the food is SO SO SO amazing, I will be back. I think next time I will be more vocal and demanding so I don't end up wasting my entire evening waiting on the waiter.", "Date": "2009-09-18", "Author_Location": "Minneapolis, MN"}, {"Author": "Afsheen F.", "ReviewID": "A_w7fRMgGR5ocy9ckQwaGw", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is a rare restaurant that makes me vow never to come back, and even rarer when a restaurant is so disappointing that I cannot even finish my food. This is such a place.I understand why people come here. It has a nice atmosphere, and it is (as far as I know) the only Thai place in the NE. However, the food and service leave much to be desired.While I appreciate good service - a restaurant with bad service and good food gets a pass in my book. At Sen Yai, the food cannot make up for the service, nor can the service make up for the food. The server was prompt initially, yet was slow to bring our beverages, and even slower in returning to take our order. It was poor service defined: every time we needed something we had to wait several minutes, realize that the server was not coming, then attempt to flag said server whenever we saw him next. Then wait for an even longer time for a glass of water, or another beer. Simply unacceptable.The food was terrible. I, seemingly like many fellow Yelpers, have spent a good amount of time in Thailand. This doesn't compare. It doesn't compare to Taste of Thailand. It doesn't compare to my first attempt to make pad thai upon returning from Thailand. The pad thai at Sen Yai was bland. Yes, it looked like it had the proper ingredients - but somehow it was missing all of the flavor. The tilapia was slightly better, at least it was spicy like I asked, but it was just heat without flavor. Again, very disappointing. I don't even want to delve into the appetizers, we had the lettuce wraps - aka some pieces of snail-rejected lettuce with some typical Thai condiments - which were not appetizing in the least. Perhaps the other appetizers would be better, but based on my experience, Sen Yai Sen Lek would have difficulty making a decent spring roll, since it had such difficulty in making a passable spring roll.The food was overpriced compared to what you can find in Frogtown, similarly priced to the Thai offering in Uptown, all of which have better food. I was pleased with the beer selection though, and was glad to have the option of mourning the terrible food with a solid Thai beer.

We also split the Papaya Salad & the Red Curry du jour. \u00a0Both packed some heat & were loaded with fresh tasting tidbits. \u00a0Admittedly, we waited quite some time for our dessert HOWEVER the sticky rice, coconut milk, banana concotion was DeeeLiCious! \u00a0Warm, creamy & cozy; it settles the tummy. \u00a0You're nuts not to at least try this place!", "Date": "2010-03-29", "Author_Location": "St Paul, MN"}, {"Author": "Hannah F.", "ReviewID": "pUK7LDHx2kogHBKAYEKlZA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The food was ok. \u00a0I found it a bit pricy and underwhelming.", "Date": "2011-05-11", "Author_Location": "Bucktown, Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Peter Q.", "ReviewID": "dN0-BnPcgWz7tTFKD9S0bQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The daily curry specials are fantastic.Very friendly and they don't hustle you out to fill more tables-- perfect for a relaxing dinner.", "Date": "2011-11-01", "Author_Location": "Minneapolis, MN"}, {"Author": "Melissa N.", "ReviewID": "h2vfzrYD8FwkXs2wXSO44g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome food.

I will admit my expectations were not that high but wow did they deliver. All three of us loved what we ordered. I had some kind of thinly sliced steak salad with fresh lime and sticky rice. I also had some pretty damn good Thai iced coffee. They have some pretty unique beers as well.This is a family owned and run place and they do things right. What I really loved is that they get just about all of their ingredients from local farmers. My steak came from a small farm in Cannon Falls where they raise grass fed cows. Amazing! They only sell soda made with cane sugar in the bottle. They want nothing to do with nasty corn syrup based crap here. They're very into recycling as well. They use Eureka. Make sure you ask for their little table tray of peppers. Any place that is locally owned and uses top notch local ingredients AND is eco friendly is rad. Oh and they do have some lunch specials where you can get slightly smaller portions.

Booths down the right side table in the centre and along the left side, there is another area to the right of the front door where there is a bar ans seating and more tables.The staff although friendly seemed sometimes distant and aloof, maybe we shouldn't have told the waiter we were Thai food novices.The menus are colorful, and laid out well, easy to read, with descriptions of each dish and the prices displayed along with the options for various dishes. The beverage menu is simple and very adequate; we opted for a couple of local draft beers and a bottle of Riesling Kabinett; we were a party of four. The beer and wine came promptly, but no cooler for the white wine.The beer and wine came promptly, but no cooler for the white wine.For appetizers we had the Po Pia Tod, Po Pia Sod and Gai Satay, my wife and son had the Tom Yum. Very delicious except for the Tom Yum, too much fiber, too many sticks and bits of bamboo not enough of the meat or tofu. My son bit into a chile, ouch! \u00a0For our meals; \u00a0Moo Tod Gratiem for the women, my son had Khao Soi and I had Geow Naam Moo Daeng. The Moo Tod Gratiem didn't match expectations, the sticky rice wasn't and the fried strips of pork were too dry. One gets the impression that the meals sat under a heat lamp which rendered the sticky rice dry and crispy and the fried pork dry and leathery. The Khao Soi looked good, the presentation was good but again not as expected; too watery and lacking substance. My Geow Naam Moo Daeng was OK, the won tons were flavourful but there was a lack of cabbage and onions, I had plenty of noodles and bean sprouts but the dish was awash with an oily broth.We ordered desert; three fried bananas with coconut ice cream and one chocolate ice cream. The fried bananas were dry and tasted starchY; deep fried in batter should have been crispy and light but were instead heavy, starchy and flavourless, the coconut ice cream was also disappointing, a bland white ice cream with dried coconut flakes. The chocolate ice cream was good. So as Thai novices our overall impression was not good. I have eaten Thai food in other cities and here in Minneapolis but never in Thailand so I don't know what is authentic and what is dumbed down for US taste. I haven't eaten enough different Thai dishes or the same dish in different restaurants. So I am not really qualified to be critical of the authenticity of the food we ate, I am however qualified to be a critic of what I was served versus what I expected from the menu description and the waiter's explanation of what was to come, and I know overcooked from just right.I may go back if only to have a beer and several appetizers, they were really good. Perhaps I should try some more Thai restaurants and see if I actually like Thai cuisine. \u00a0 I thought I did!", "Date": "2009-08-24", "Author_Location": "Shoreview, MN"}, {"Author": "Taylor M.", "ReviewID": "HpYwryHeWirct-25zsHS7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Took my college academic team to this restaurant without a reservation on a busy Saturday night. \u00a0We asked to sit on the floor around the big table in the \"waiting room\"/bar area and they were quick to accommodate. \u00a0Service was wonderful and fast. \u00a0We had some people with special dietary issues (vegetarian, gluten-free) who easily found delicious options on the menu. \u00a0The drinks were authentic and the food was incredible. \u00a0I was happy to discover that the assistant manager, manager, and owner of the restaurant were Minnesota-nice and they consider the environmental impact of their business. \u00a0I will definitely go back and I highly recommend it to everyone I know!", "Date": "2013-01-26", "Author_Location": "Saint Louis, MO"}, {"Author": "Mindy E.", "ReviewID": "6kuW69Nua_qSiKfDgPvnEw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband and I really like this little gem.
