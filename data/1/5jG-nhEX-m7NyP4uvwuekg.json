The owner, Rick, and Chef, Jamie, proudly display their names on the menu and do so with reason and that pride can be seen in all aspects of the experience. Rick continues to be the best host in Columbus, and is most certain to check on your table to confirm that they have hit the mark. The kitchen \u00a0always provide a meal and experience that pleases your tastebuds. The wait staff is always attentive, courteous and knowledgeable regardless of whether it is busy or slow. The bartenders are always friendly and mix excellent drinks. Tonight I had the Wine Wednesay Prix Fixe and it did not disappoint. The lentil meatballs were amazing, and I hate lentils. The watermelon salad, was the perfect starter on a summer day. As someone with a sweet tooth, it is nearly impossible not to indulge in a dessert after dinner. It is hard to pick a favorite or even one as they all are excellent, but the tiramisu and pistachio gelato are a good place to start. If you are in the mood for seafood the scallops will not disappoint. Some nights I lay awake dreaming of the steak, or lamb. When I over order, which is not hard to do with a menu stacked so full of goodness, I have to worry that my wife will eat my leftovers. For salad lovers the beet salad and Caesar are must haves. You cannot go wrong selecting a pasta or pizza. Whether you eat inside or on the patio Z continues to improve upon its ambience, and has a classic look that is well maintained.  I also highly recommend having them cater or host a special event or business meeting as the owner will make it stress free.", "Date": "2014-06-11", "Author_Location": "Columbus, OH"}, {"Author": "Tim G.", "ReviewID": "B4DGWPpNI2ug9yN43qnyvA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We visit Z as often as possible the food, atmosphere and service is awesome!Rick Ziliak , the owner is a true gentleman and excellent restauranteur!", "Date": "2014-06-11", "Author_Location": "Columbus, OH"}, {"Author": "Tony B.", "ReviewID": "CJkP7FLcsq69x1Nl3hIsug", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I have been eating at Z regularly since it opened - I met Rick when he was at the North Market. \u00a0In the 8 years since it opened, we have observed Z mature from a nice local restaurant to Best in Class!

To begin our meal, we ordered the sampler platter and a bottle of the Guenoc Claret. The sampler platter included three \"regulars\" (calamari fritti, house-made mozzarella, and ricotta balls) and three \"chef's specials\" (swordfish, roasted red pepper cheese dip, and squash salad). I was a fan of the ricotta balls and the roasted red pepper dip!After the appetizers, the \"riserva\" salad and the potato leek soup (the daily soup special). The riserva salad had great flavor - the chianti vinaigrette defined the greens. The potato leek soup was also delicious - smooth and creamy.For the main courses, we ordered: the daily ravioli special, the short ribs, the duck legs and house-made gnocchi. Like I said, I should have written this review right (or shortly) after our meal, but I didn't...*sigh*. All I remember is that my daily ravioli special was one of the big hits of the table. The duck legs were another hit - although, they weren't shared! :) The house-made gnocchi were also delish - I actually don't think any of us had a bad dish that night.For dessert, we ordered two dishes: (1) Z Cucina's signature dessert, the Butterscotch Pannacotta, which was surprisingly delish (I say that, because I'm not sure I would have ordered it based on the description alone)! Note that the menu does not denote this dessert as its \"signature\" dish - we wouldn't have known if we hadn't been told beforehand.(2) Bread Pudding - I would be more descriptive (i.e., the type of bread pudding appears to be updated periodically), but I cannot remember what type of bread pudding we had.

My friend and I were looking for a place to eat after going to the gym today and we were going to Vino Vino across the street (b/c of yelp reviews). When we arrived, we were curious about Z Cucina, which was across the street. We walked over to Z to check out the menu, which was annoying pasted on the wall at about waist height. While I was bent over reading, the owner popped out and asked if we'd like to come in. Why not, we thought? So we did.Our waiter was bright and cheery and got us bread and oil and water right away. Sigh, but that's where the good all ends. We ordered the walnut/gorgonzola/grape salad, the soup, the mozzarella over zucchini and almonds WITH 3 yr old aged balsamic vinegar, and the vegetarian special to split - a mushroom rosti, which was like a potato patty, over a squash puree, and topped with a fried local egg, truffle oil, and frisee.So all the food was just \"meh\" to not very good. I wasn't too impressed with the bread, especially since it had salt baked into the crust. Nice touch, but it was too salty and the crust wasn't that great. It was however, soft, and warm. It was served with a plate of oil and aged balsamic (you could tell from its syrupy consistency) which was the best part of the dinner. My friend said the soup was good, and the salad was ooookay. Nothing special - I could have made it myself. The gorgonzola really didn't taste like much and the walnuts were overtoasted. The homemade mozzarella dish I really wanted to like. But the mozzarella didn't taste like anything! It wasn't that great milky flavor you get from good fresh mozz. And it was over zucchini and slivered almonds, which was a strange combination. Additionally, the aged balsamic we paid extra to have on top just got diluted in the zucchini juices so it wasn't even anything special!Finally, the entree - the squash puree tasted salty, but totally watery (couldn't taste the squash really) the rosti, which was a mushroom/potato patty, was very salty also and slightly bitter. Nothing spectacular at all about it. My coworker took one bite and totally didn't want anymore. I didn't think it was that bad, but it certainly wasn't very good. I rarely ever say food doesn't taste good.Sadly, the owner who had enticed us in came over to ask how it was and I didn't have the heart to say.Overall, everything was flavorless, but salty.

He ordered the Mojitalian and I had a glass of Savignon Blanc that was organic, each $5. The Mojitalian was tasty but not very alcoholic, and the wine was refreshing (but this is coming from someone who is not a wine connoisseur, and is usually satisfied with most wines). We also ordered small plates of pancetta, caprese, risotto fritters, and a flatbread with house-made sausage. Each of the small plates was $5, and the flatbread was $9. The pancetta was almost paper thin and crispy, sitting atop a small bed of shredded romaine, sliced cherry tomatoes, and a gorgonzola aioli that we mistook for mayo. It was tasty, but I'm not the biggest bacon fan and this dish didn't knock my socks off, so I don't think I'd order it again. I thought the caprese was the star of the meal. I have never seen so much mozzarella on a caprese app before. We had 3, or maybe 4 (my memory is a little fuzzy since we nom'ed so quickly on everything) hunks of fresh mozzarella that resembled little scoops of vanilla ice cream. Mmmm... I love fresh mozzarella with tomatoes and basil, so that plate alone made my night. My boyfriend enjoyed the fritters the best. It was hot when it got to the table and had an ooey gooey cheesy center when we broke into them. They were also topped with shredded parm and accompanied with a small side of tomato sauce.

Of course, I agreed and was thrilled to be a part of such a special occasion. Fast forward several months later and it's time for the bachelorette party. The maid of honor had what was thought to be a perfect plan for the evening out. Enter the bride: disapproved!! Oh no!

I accepted this impossible challenge and began calling places in the Short North. I was shot down by three restaurants before deciding to shift my neighborhood preference to Grandview. I had enjoyed previous visits to Z Cucina but still thought there wasn't a chance in hell they could help me. Sometimes (well, maybe just this once) it's great to be wrong. The owner Rick answered the phone. Once I explained the direness of my situation he was happy to make some rearrangements to table placement and fit us in. Excuse me? Did you just say you can help me? WIN!! So, the next day we arrived promptly as I was instructed since they were bending over backward for us and needed us to be there on time. That is the kind of service that just blows me away. The restaurant didn't have to help me, they didn't have to do anything nice and they didn't owe me any favors, but managed to offer up one of the nicest things any restaurant has ever done for me...so, you had me at \"of course we can help you.\" It was as if nothing dramatic ever happened; it was truly a pleasant time. Lots of drinking, laughing and excellent food. That night I tried the scallop special and really liked it, although some others in the group tried it and thought it was just ok. It seemed we all could agree on the Parmigiano Risotto Fritters. Oh my, they are little balls of cheesy heaven.

First off, the bread, although served in 5 varieties from olive to rosemary to white to wheat was good but suffered from too much surface area (crisp) and not enough center (soft,) while the garlic butter was overpowering. \u00a0Next up, the Z Tasting Plate with Bluefin Crudo, Ricotta Spinach Spread, Orange-Arugala-Fennel Salad, Calamari Fritti, Parmigiano Risotta Fritters, House Made Mozzarella. \u00a0A ton of options for a mere $19, no item was bad, but the only one that truly stood out was the incredibly fresh crudo with melt-in-your-mouth bluefin tuna as fine as any high end sushi shop....the rest were relatively standard fare and the squid was tough/gummy.For mains we selected:1) Garganelle con Langostina with artisanal pasta, langoustines, sundried tomatoes, spinach, and seafood cream sauce -- Decent with well done al dente pasta and great tomatoes, but notably shredded langoustine clearly from the body and not the claw. \u00a0The cream sauce, noted to be light, was significantly briney and actually hindered the dish even for a seafood lover like myself.2) Tortellini Gamberi with cheese, jumbo shrimp, asparagus, prosciutto di parma, lemon and butter -- Great shirmp, delicious sauce, but poorly cooked Tortellini that was simply too tough for my palate, though my mother enjoyed it.3) \u00a0Cappesante al Forno Roasted scallops, grilled corn polenta, pickled pear tomatoes, red onions, and fennel -- Incredible Scallops, well seared, and a deliciously creamy yet textured Polenta....yet completely offset by sour and acidic pickled tomatoes. \u00a0This dish could have been amazing were it not for the tomatoes which unbalanced all aspects of the dish.4) House Made Gnocchi with Pesto, shrimp, sweet tomatoes -- The pesto was stellar, the shrimp plump, and the tomatoes delicious (the kind of tomatoes that could have made the Cappesante)....but as I've noted in the past, gnocchi is either done right or done wrong and this was UNEVENNESS at the max. \u00a0Some pieces soft and perfect, others tough and gummy...and considering the griddle marks on the noodles I get the idea the chef was aware (grilling to firm up overcooked gnocchi gone soft is a 'technique' of sorts.) \u00a0Disappointing.For dessert, like many other Columbus staples, Jeni made an appearance in nearly every dish. \u00a0Selections included:1) Lavender Peach Tarte Tatin with Salty Caramel Ice Cream -- Delicious and large with wonderful peaches and a crispy crust yet a perfect air of Lavender that greeted both the tastebuds and nostrils, this dish was further complemented by the wonderful dip of salty caramel at its center. \u00a0A standout for sure amongst the choices, but not as good as that at Rigsby's the night before.2) Chocolate Crespelle with Black Currant Syrup, Hazelnuts, Basil --Interesting, like a baked crepe with 72% dark cocoa in the middle, but nothing special and neither the syrup nor basil were notable over the dominant chocolate tones.3) Panettone Bread Pudding with Cherry Lambic Sorbetto --Undoubtedly better than the poor versions served at Lindey's and Deepwood, this dessert was actually quite tasty. \u00a0Then again, when you take a world famous bread, douse it in cream, and top it with award winning icecream, how can you go wrong?4) Butterscotch Panna Cotta with Chocolate Hazelnut Biscotti --Their trademark dessert, this one was a glimpse of flawless evenness and wonderful taste. \u00a0A thick top layer of butterscotch flan over a base of gooey caramel, the only thing that could have made this dish better was some beignets for dunking a la Michael Mina.See profile site for full review with formatted pics.", "Date": "2008-08-03", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Edy D.", "ReviewID": "W42H4h6IWK6S99Oz6z30SA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We gathered at Z's for Happy Hour and Appies.

If you've spent your entire life eating what places like Olive Garden and Buca di Bepo have conned you in to thinking was Italian food, you owe it to yourself to check this place out. Everything comes together perfectly here- the staff, the beautifully understated dining room, the adventurous yet incredibly accessible menu- to create an almost unbeatable dining experience that will linger in your memory for years.I had my first taste of Z about three years ago when a friend of mine took me here to check out their Monday night happy hour special, which boasted half off drinks at the bar and a small yet amply supplied buffet setup. The idea of having a buffet in what's supposed to be a classy Italian bistro may seem crass at first, but they pulled it off rather well and in a tasteful manner. The first item I sampled was the risotto, a dish I was completely unfamiliar with until that point. I ended up loving it- the texture was firm and moist, and the sauce had a very gourmet wine taste to it that was exciting and new to me. Why Chef Boyardee hasn't tried risotto is beyond me. Anyways, the buffet also included a parmesan ravioli and marinara penne dishes, both of which were basic but done to absolute perfection. I could only imagine how incredible they would've tasted when served as entrees as opposed to large buffet-style steamer trays. The one dish that keeps me going back to Z Cucina is the chicken parmesan. Besides being absolutely huge, the texture of the chicken that's hiding somewhere under all of that silky cheese and tangy sauce is an enigma that has kept me coming back for the past two years. How they pack that much flavor in to a simple slab of breaded chicken will remain a mystery to me, and it's certainly worth your educated guess. The dining room is perfectly lit and decorated, the food is amazing, and the price is just right.

My friend order the mushroom flatbread. The mushrooms were the best bite of the night. Big chunks, seasoned and cooked perfectly. Simply delicious. My Caesar salad was bleh. The grilled chicken I ordered to go on it was overlooked to the thready stage. And two pieces of sliced cheese laid across the top just wasn't a pleasing bite.

A good time was definitely on board regardless of the food, as two of my favorite dining companions joined me on a breezy autumn evening.We were immediately greeted after being led to our table and were quickly overwhelmed with a throng of words, which we soon learned were the daily specials. The Z Tavola tasting platter allowed us to sample the restaurant's wide spectrum of appetizers. The three mainstays included the Calamari Fritti, Parmigiano Risotto Fritters, and the House-Made Mozzarella. The three chef's creations of the night happened to be a Mediterranean sardine concoction, pumpkin spread with baguette, and a fruit medley. The calamari fritti particularly stood out as the squid had been lightly battered, flash fried, and topped with a memorable shallot sauce. The parmagiano risotto fritters were equally delectable, with the distinct flavor of mozzarella contrasting nicely with the piquant tomato sauce. The fruit medley would have to be my least favorite of the six, since it was a mixture of raisins and cranberries. Paired with the pumpkin dip, however, the combination made for a refreshing appetizer.The bread basket was then presented -- which I found to be slightly odd. The warm herb and olive oil infused bread was tasty enough as is that the olive oil balsamic dipping sauce proved to be highly unnecessary.Hesitating between the Orange Sage Veal Loin and the daily special of Confit Risotto, the former trumped in a heartbeat when I saw Yukon Gold Potatoes as the accompanying starch. The veal loin itself was well-seasoned and spiced. A few squirts of lemon juice would have made it more enjoyable, however. The green beans and the aforementioned potatoes were slightly undercooked making them the crunchy components to my main. Whether that was intentional on the chef's part is beyond me, but I do like my potatoes a little softer (i.e. more cooked) in order to bring out the natural buttery taste.As a closure to dinner, ordering the Butterscotch Panna Cotta was a no-brainer. It was Z Cucina's signature dessert, and I could see why. A chocolate coated biscotti was served alongside a martini glass filled with layers of rich, thick caramel and gelatinous textured cream of milk and sugar. Absolutely divine.There were certainly a few hits and misses throughout the night. Both of my friends raved about their entrees (juicy scallops and the risotto), while both unanimously agreed on the uninspiring dessert libations, particularly the Z Caffe.Our charming server remained attentive and helpful during dinner -- being quick to answer any questions we had in regards to the ingredients and such. The restaurant itself was strewn with white fabrics, which transformed a rather plain looking space into a more elegant and more inviting area.
