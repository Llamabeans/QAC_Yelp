I looked up my bookmarks and this was one of my top spots. I directed our group of 6 as we walked there from Eataly. The streets and ambiance started to get a little seedier. Vendors from all sorts of stores and kiosks were screaming out to us in hopes we would buy something from them. Some did get uncomfortably close. The closer we got to NoMad some in our group started to request we turn back. We were from out of town after all and definitively not familiar with the area. I insisted we keep going and ultimately everyone was very happy that I did! It was really cold outside and this was just the perfect place to warm up. Book lined walls enveloped us as we slowly took off our many layers and settled into our cozy little table. We all ordered all sorts of cocktails, wine and beer and enjoyed our down time. There were other groups hanging out there just like us, a couple here and there snuggling in a corner, and many people enjoying the pleasurable solitude a good book can bring. Service prompt and attentive. By the time it was time to go, the drinks had set in and we were feeling very relaxed. The walk back to Eataly was more or a stroll. What vendors?

Although Lantern's Keep will always hold a special place in my heart, all my fave people at LK have since then moved on to greener pastures, and NoMad does me the favour of providing me a beautiful library setting to sip truly delicious libations. Don't care to lounge? They have high top tables \u00a0by the bar where you can stand and socialize with your friends (and other strangers who might rub elbows with you). In fact, the bar at the NoMad hotel has now become so popular that I can no longer waltz in at 10 PM on a Saturday night and expect to be seated immediately.. it takes a good 30-45 minutes.Among their drinks, I could recommend many but the particular standouts are the Start me Up among the darker spirits (a Bourbon/Ginger based drink), Petticoat about the light ones (a spicy gin concoction). Thoughtful that they are, there is also a selection of non alcoholic cocktails on the menu, which I very much enjoyed for the better part of last year.My main (and possibly only) gripe with this place is that their vegetarian menu options are very limited. That, and of course the raging popularity of this bar that has since translated into half hour plus waits for me.

The hostess in turn called over another waitress to take my drink order. I had the Petticoat [sichuan peppercorn infused gin, apricot liqueur, velvet falernum, and lemon]. It was sweet due to the lemon and apricot liqueur but left a spicy undertone on the back of the tongue because of the sichuan peppercorn. Definitely refreshing and nice for a summer's eve drink.

As one enters the back bar area with its limited seating and lighting effects focused from unseen points, The Library's entrance is on the left through tall curtains. There is a separate attendant stand there with a service area tucked away near it too.The Library is a comfortable and welcome addition to the bar area, but rather than being there in a support role of the bar, it stands equally with friendly waitresses, sommelier service, and light bar foods menu. As we darkened the doors there, we had just returned from a good round of strong drinks at The Greensquare Tavern and were ready for another moment to celebrate. To my surprise, most of the tables were marked as \"reserved\". I interpreted this as the management's subtle way of keeping the area autonomous and free of hangers on from the bar area.The guardian of the podium asked us if we were there for dinner and I added we were guests of the hotel with flash of my hotel card, which seemed to illuminate our path to one of the tables and two fat chairs. Looking into the greater area, there were a few people in suits having themselves an intense discussion (for world domination?) and there were the few ubiquitous Apple laptop users who might have migrated from the nearby Breslin/Ace Hotel lobby (always funny hipster scene with 50 people typing away and not talking). Settling in, we embraced the service of the restaurant's sommelier, who made an excellent reference to a sparkling Cremant de Bourgogne. We found his polite and educational notes to be very interesting and well sourced as well asked a few questions about the wine list.The Library's composition slowly became more crowded with the background lighting seeming to fade slowly and we saw evidence of \"power dinners\" and few \"hot dates\", which seemed to be pushing the waitresses to even greater heights of service. The Library reminded me of some other venues in NYC that radiated with luxury and a presence, such as The National Arts Club and The Campbell Apartment. It also reminded me of what an outstanding venue The NoMad is and why I look forward to returning there when I am able.", "Date": "2013-04-02", "Author_Location": "Jacksonville, FL"}, {"Author": "susan m.", "ReviewID": "32Kj5NH8Ntuu3qP8buzXug", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Many many open tables but I was told there is a 45-60 minute wait, at 4pm on a Friday.

The NoMad Library Bar within the NoMad Hotel is your place to find some of the libations in the city. We stumbled upon this bar because of the other Yelp reviews and we were definitely not disappointed. It was a Saturday afternoon, around 4pm and the place was crowded - we found a small area near the bar to have our first drink and waited to be seated at a table (about 45 minutes later). But it was well worth the wait. The seating area is basically the library, hence the name, with books upon books around you. The atmosphere reminds me of a speak easy and definitely the drinks are what draws the crowd. The combination of flavors and alcohol would bring me back time and time again as a place I could relax and catch up with friends.There is quite a selection of mixed drinks and your traditional scotches, vodkas and others, but we had the Mint julep. Old Alhambra. Black Thorn, among other specialty cocktails that were on the menu.

To get to the bar you have to walk through the dining area (NoMad Restaurant), which is equally beautiful with a variety of seating. The aromas of the food are unbearably wonderful. If you come here stuffed, you will inevitably get hungry again. I got the rosemary flatbread at the bar, which was really well made, flavorful, and just the perfect amount. It was only $6.
