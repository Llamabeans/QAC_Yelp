After one too many dinners at a bar, I was craving some Thai, and SEA was close by and reasonably priced. The decor was beautiful, the ambiance was nice, and the glass of Riesling I had was perfect. It went downhill from there. (Speaking of the wine... There is no bar at SEA. So, if you order a drink, be prepared to wait until they fetch it from the abyss.)We started with a shared appetizer of spring rolls, which tasted like... nothing. I mean, I guess it could have been worse and they tasted bad, right?Next, our waiter. I got the distinct impression he was making fun of us, like we've ever eaten Thai before. Not cool, dude, not cool. My friend ordered a dish, but asked that, on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being ridic hot), her meal was between a 2 and a 3. I asked for green curry, with a \"4.\" Apparently, this was hilarious. The meals finally come out, and.... my friend's dish has NO heat, and if my green curry was a \"4\" on the heat level, then that's just sad, y'all. I can't remember the last time there were peas and portobello mushrooms in a curry, but it didn't taste bad... Just sad.

They've transported the hanging chairs, rectangular pond, the statue, the caged area, the wood accents, and menu to Vegas now. No deejay, though, at least on weekdays.Prices are much higher (about twice as much) and service is slower (even though the place is a third the size of Brooklyn's). The entrees were $16 - $18/each.Their menu is Vietnamese on one side and Thai on the other. Ingredients are fresh and dishes are well-balanced. Good-sized portions and the kitchen is good with custom orders. Stand-out dishes are the drunken noodles, pad thai, and pineapple fried rice.Unfortunately, the smoky smoky smoky air brought this from a 4-star down to a 3. The water also tasted chlorine-y, which should bring this down to a 2.5, except that the servers are extra-courteous (e.g., rushing to get a to-go cup so I could bring my iced coffee with me when I left).", "Date": "2011-08-09", "Author_Location": "Newport Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Kelly B.", "ReviewID": "SxOWPhV5Pik8sQ6UH6AWJQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love SEA Brooklyn, I hate SEA Manhattan.

Perfect combination of sweet, spicy and peanutty-ness. The ambiance was very mellow and chill. Very modern Asian feel. Our booth was in a corner so had to slide all the way over to get some privacy from the booth right next to us. They had some fresh roses placed on the tables and fake candles to add to the mood.

I think if someone requests to withhold a major ingredient the price should be lesson (like an easy $2 less or something). It's located in the Bally's Casino and Hotel next to a Steak House and Cantina. Would probably not go again just because of the price.
