I ordered toasted ravioli for the table since they had never tried it and it gotten eaten up quickly. Our servers got our used plates out of the way quickly and brought bread and our salads. They were nice enough to bring the salad dressing on the side (without us requesting it) for everyone because the kids had never tried ranch before, and the servers wanted to make sure they had a choice if they didn't like it. Nice touch. All the kids loved it so it was used up. They kept our water glasses filled, bread plentiful, and plates cleared. Food came and the kids loved it too. I enjoyed mine. The ice cream came - another hit. We were stuffed. All for $148 for 12 people, with apps, salads and dessert, not including tip. I left a nice one - great service!

The menu was decent and so were the prices. I ordered the baked lasagna, my boyfriend ordered the spinach and cheese ravioli, Michael ordered the Fettucine Alfredo, his son Keaton ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce (from the kids menu), and his step-daughter Kylee ordered the spaghetti with marinara sauce (also from the kids menu). For appetizers for all of us, Michael ordered the cheese bread, olive tapenade, and toasted ravioli. We got our food within ten minutes.

I've got to admit this travel thing has gotten old, and quick. Not that St. Louis has bad food, because it doesn't.Anyways, being rather tired for a LATE flight into town the night prior I decided to keep things close to my hote. Seeing as I always stay at the Gateway Arch Hampton, restaurants in the Landing are quite close. Old Spaghetti Factory is one of the few places at this point I have not been to down there.At first I didn't realize that this is a chain, but then I remember a long time ago I had been to the one in Columbus OH. As usual when I am in St. Louis I sat at the bar, alone; which, normally I would say that is a big indicator of a restaurant, but it always seems that these places are slow when I am in town. I ordered the lasagna which came with a house salad and bread. The salad honestly was your typical Dole straight out of a bag lettuce mix and there was NO flavor to the dressing. When I get caesar dressing on my salad I want that signature tang that caesar dressing should have; this dressing was boring and muted, no tang, no garlic, nothing. On the menu, it said the lasagna was baked, and always fresh. I got the feeling that this stuff was something similar to the Stouffer's lasagna you can buy in the grocery store. The ricotta was dry, and much like the salad there really wasn't a whole lot of flavor to it. The only real saving grace to my whole meal was the two pints of Schlafly Heffeweisen I had. For a town that gets lot's of attention because of Anheiuser (yuck) it amazes me that you don't hear much/anything about this beer elsewhere, they brew some AMAZING beer, so much so a buddy of mine from back home keeps asking me to bring a case back with me each time I'm down here.I'm half tempted to give this place a two, but the bartender who served me last night was very nice, and friendly so I'll give it a three.

Can't beat food like this for the price. We are locals and have been hundreds of times so have had both good/bad service, and good/bad food experiences. Meatloaf used to be my favorite but the past two times it was dry, lacked flavor and gave me a belly ache....could have been bad. Stick with the browned butter and mizithra cheese dish. Its the best. If it tastes like a burnt grilled cheese, they cooked the butter too long, send it back. When its done the way it should its HEAVEN!
