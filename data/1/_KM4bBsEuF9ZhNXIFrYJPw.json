The place is modern and reminds me of the white washed buildings in the Islands of Greece. \u00a0We ordered several appetizers (mezedes) and they were all pretty bland. \u00a0We ordered the assorted spread platter and were told that they were out of two of the spreads they offer. \u00a0 How this is possible on the start of a Friday night?? We moved on to order the Green Chick Pea spread, which was flavorless. \u00a0The zucchini chips (hot and crispy), but served with a tzatziki type sauce that had so much dill - it was not edible. \u00a0We also had the fried calamari and that was seasoned nicely and served hot. The cheese Saganki was a disaster. Our Saganki was accidentally given to the table across from us (who was in the process of paying their bill at the time) and the remake was a cast iron soup of lemon and cognac/brandy. The lamb sausage was a traditional Greek Loukaniko with spikes of orange peel, but for $12 for one link, I could have purchased 2 packs (8) from our local Greek grocer! \u00a0We ordered the ribeye for dinner and that was forgettable and overcooked.

I've experienced better\" is perfect description for how I feel about my \"experience\" here. My \"better\" is New York City's AVRA. (That said, I cannot believe I just noticed I never even reviewed it. Oooops! Will fix that very soon). Parked with Thaso's valet service and walked inside to check-in for our reservation. No one that worked there was at the desk initially. After a minute or so of standing there, a gentleman walked up and attempted to \"check us in.\" \"What was your last name again?\" We said it, (and showed him on the screen) three times, before he \"got it.\"He walked us to a booth, we sat and he gave us menus. Our waiter came by, introduced himself and asked our water preference. Jason, our waiter, had a contagious smile. I wish all waiters were this pleasant. I could not help but be happy with him around. Unfortunately, his smile could only go so far. Thasos fell flat on most dishes and I doubt I will ever return given the choice. TOAST/EGGPLANT DIP- The eggplant consistency was that of a puree and it was excellent. The toast was cold. Blah.CURED ORGANIC SCOTTISH SALMON CARPACCIO- Listed as having cucumber, salmon caviar and dill crema as sides. The crema had the cucumber in it and was very good. The caviar was not there. When we mentioned it to Jason, he also admitted he didn't see it on the plate. The actual carpaccio wasn't bad. It just wasn't delicious. I'm not sure what it's \"cured\" with, but it gave the salmon a heavy glaze and took away from it's firmness making it, well, heavy. GRILLED HALUMI CHEESE- Hmmmm I was so excited for this, but ended up very disappointed. It definitely had \"grill\" marks, but it was cold upon arrival and had a crumbly texture. Sigh. The accompanying greens were dry and unappetizing. The quince was a good mix with the cheese had it been hot. GRILLED OCTOPUS- OK. Just OK. GRILLED LAMB CHOPS- This was the best dish of the night. Ordered \"medium\", but delivered \"well.\" This was similar to Danielle R.'s experience. Somehow, the \"well\" worked. It had a nice char and was still somewhat juicy enough to enjoy. These 4 chops were very flavorful. The accompanying potatoes were also delicious. The green beans were soggy though. Sigh.VANILLA CREME BRULEE- Received the espresso creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for my husband who specifically said he didn't want espresso. Mentioned it to Jason who confirmed it, but didn't offer to correct it or remove it from the bill. THYME BREAD PUDDING- Didn't taste like thyme. It tasted like the fruit it had on top (maybe apples? can't recall). Whatever it was, it was very good! The portion was too big for me to finish. Ended with a couple of espressos and called it a night. Thasos was all about ambiance and not too much substance. The music was blaring in the background and was mostly TOP 40's (not \u00a0too clubby). The restaurant's very cool all-white decor lends itself as an IT place to gather a large party or celebration. This was not enough for me. I can appreciate a good looking place, but it has to follow up with the food. Sadly, I wasn't impressed. P.S. The couple of flies constantly hovering over our (indoor) table was also a nuisance.

Miami style!!! This restaurant is also great for big groups... particularly if you are a party of 10 you can ask to sit in a long table with these chairs that are shaped like the back of a man or woman towards the back of the restaurant. \u00a0Very cool look!!!We arrived on time for our reservation. \u00a0At the \"desk\" there was an older gentleman sitting there. \u00a0When we attempted to check in, we realize that he didn't speak English so we waited. \u00a0I think Greek may have been his language of choice and my Greek is a bit rusty... OK it's non-existent! \u00a0Another employee came by and attempted to check us in. \u00a0We stated who we were three times and he seemed as clueless as the older gentleman. \u00a0I finally pointed to the computer screen where our name was and he thanked us. \u00a0We sat towards the back of the restaurant next to these big sliding windows facing a very nice outdoor area where a few families were already being served. \u00a0The second thing I noticed, after the d\u00e9cor of course, is the size of the flies that were hanging out by the big sliders. \u00a0After trying to swat a few of them with the menu, I gave up and just tried to keep them away from my Cabernet. \u00a0We got Jason as our server... a very personable young man. \u00a0He opened our wine (restaurant has a $25 corkage fee) and we got underway with the salmon carpaccio, the octopus and the halumi as written on the menu (or haloumi as written on the bill). \u00a0 I did not love the carpaccio. The salmon had a \"coating like\" glaze that I did not enjoy. \u00a0I didn't know what it was and Jason didn't know either. \u00a0I liked the halumi even less. \u00a0It sounded promising... I mean how can grilled cheese not sound promising? \u00a0In the end, it was disappointing. \u00a0I don't know if the cheese was supposed to be served room temperature but ours was. \u00a0I thought if the cheese had been served hot or hotter it would have been better. \u00a0As for the octopus, it was fine. \u00a0Well cooked. It was accompanied with a bit of a salad but the salad could have used a bit of a dressing.For the main plate, we order the grilled lamb chops to share. They were well cooked and had flavor. \u00a0Good, just not spectacular. \u00a0The chops came with lemon roasted potatoes and string beans. \u00a0The potatoes were good.For dessert Jason recommended with special Espresso Cr\u00e8me Brulee but I ordered the Vanilla Bean one off the menu. \u00a0The wife ordered the Bread Pudding. \u00a0 After a few bites I realized that I had gotten the espresso cr\u00e8me brulee. \u00a0Jason came over and agreed they had brought me the wrong dessert. \u00a0No offer to bring me the right one so I just finished off the espresso cr\u00e8me brulee. \u00a0It was okay. \u00a0I usually don't like coffee tasting desserts so I am not surprised I didn't love this one. \u00a0I think the wife gave me a taste of her bread pudding but I can't comment as I don't remember.Although Jason had a great personality and if I ever go back I would love to have him as my waiter, service didn't go smoothly. \u00a0I can't help but think that had they opened the slider but for a minute, the flies would have departed. \u00a0I also didn't get the right dessert. \u00a0I wasn't offered a replacement and I was surprised to see it on the bill. \u00a0Also, as it turns out, the young man forgot to check us in via the Open Table reservation system because the next day we got an email from Open Table saying we failed to honor our reservation. \u00a0On a final note, as I write this review, I notice the restaurant did not charge me the $25 corkage fee. \u00a0I feel like they just forgot. \u00a0Whenever a restaurant waives the corkage fee, they usually tell you they are doing so. \u00a0Here, no one said anything. \u00a0Anyways, if they did waive it on purpose, thank you very much. \u00a0But, next time, I recommend you tell your customer. \u00a0It usually ends up, at least for me, in a bigger gratuity for the waiter.", "Date": "2014-06-30", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "Yakelin S.", "ReviewID": "Ri-688bnTSGwpnrpbok-7g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good food ,very good service, nice ambiance;-) food actually as good or better than the beautiful ambiance!", "Date": "2014-07-15", "Author_Location": "Theater District, Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Robert L.", "ReviewID": "DVaNVmooSjTl4V14H6Pr3A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not bad.

The New Bedford Scallops were bland and not cold enough. The octopus was warm, but I craved hotter fish. The flavoring was delicious. The second trip we sat at the bar. My brother asked the bartender for his recommendations. Not only were his drink recommendations great, his food were even better. We ordered the keftedes, whole grilled fish, crisp smelts were tender and juicy, and the calamari was wonderful. The waitress from my Sunday night came over to say hi, which is quite sweet.

Great quality ingredients, seasoned and cooked beautifully, love the d\u00e9cor, bathrooms are clean, ... was def my top restaurant in fort Lauderdale, even with its spotty service (Dre is my fav waiter there). My last three visits were slightly disappointing, the silverwear and glasses had finger prints, tomatos from the greek salad were (for the lack of better words) grime-ish, everything was too salty, green chick pea hummus is becoming less green and less tasty. I don't know if they are trying to cut costs hence quality has suffered or what is going on. I loved going there for lunch and brunch, but I think they were not as busy for those times and only open for dinner now. Even with everything said, I still enjoy the restaurant, just wish it was more consistent and hope it is not on its way down. Some of my fav dishes: lavraki, grilled octopus, green chickpea spread, all salads are wonderful but greek is still my fav, wild mushroom side, mussels, smelts, beef tenderloin and beef skewers. I think their dessert is good, but not as great as the food. Also, as we do go quite often as a family, we have never gotten anything on the house. The only time I had anything comp'd was when there was a fly in my bottled water, they gave us a new one. Also considering how often I am there, doesn't seem they particularly appreciate my business/presence. - this is not reflected in my rating.

This will give Greek Island Terverna which has been the undisputed champ of Greek food forever a run for it's money. First the bar area is huge and beautiful, all white stone, very clean looking. Bartenders friendly and knowledgeable about the food.Valet parking, big plus, such a hassle parking at GIT.We sat at the bar to eat and have some drinks. Good wine by the glass.Started with Spanikopita, very disappointing and thought I made a mistake by not going to GIT, I started saying to myself you know what. The spanikopita had waaaaay too much phylo dough and waaaaay too little filling. Dry tasteless thing.Next we had the zaziki and eggplant spread both were excellent with tasty pita breads. Then we had the stuffed grape leaves. These were home made and not from a can. They were delicious. Better than GIT.Then came the octopus, this was a prize winner. Beats the octopus at GIT which is saying a lot. It was just perfect and super tasty.Then we had crab fritters, not a Greek dish for sure but delicious none the less. Could have used a little lemon. Then we finished up with lamb chops. Can't go to a Greek place and not have lamb of some sort. \u00a0The chops were very high quality and melt in your mouth tender But lacked that traditional Greek taste which the addition of a little lemon and some sea salt took care of right away.Slight edge here to GIT whose secret sauce is awesome but the lamb is not as good in quality. So all Thasos has to do is add a little flavor via some lemon, salt, oregano and they will be the lamb chop kings.Oh yes and we had a side of the feta with Thasos olive oil. Outstanding, much better then GTI feta. Loved it. So overall, they could use a little more lemon on some of the dishes, even the perfectly cooked octopus needed a squeeze which I forgot to mention. But other than that I think this place is here to stay and there might even be a new champion in \u00a0town very soon.And don't forget to take a picture sitting on one of the stuffed lambs in the lobby, especially if you go with kids. I did it and it's a great picture.

The place was packed on a Saturday night so a rez is recommended however we didn't have one and they seated the two of us within minutes.We kept the dinner super light as I just got over the flu the week before. We ordered the large Greek salad, zucchini chips, two glasses of their Santorini White Wine, and finally baklava. The large salad was huge. It was filled with sweet tomatoes, crisp sweet cucumbers, red onion and phenomenal aged smooth salty feta. The olives were meaty, fruity, and fresh. The dressing was a clean red wine vinegar and perfectly balanced. The zucchini chips were coated perfectly with a tasty light coating then fried perfectly. Most of the chips were absolutely perfect and not soggy what so ever. Even after sitting for a awhile at the table they stayed crispy which is impressive. On the side was a yogurt dill dip. The two pair perfectly. Santorini wine was crisp, clean, apricots, with a touch of bed linen. Kidding in the last bit . Baklava was amazing. Not overly syrupy and just a great treat in the end. I also tasted a hint of ginger was a great surprise. We washed it down with American coffee and I must say, it was truly amazing coffee. No bitterness what so ever. I drink it black. My advice is definitely order a large Greek salad to share with any entree you order. The place is very expensive with great service to match the price tag.Same prices as any high end steak house. With that said, I don't know many high end Greek places around town so if your in the mood for a high end tasty treat, head this way.

Not at all oily or greasy tasting. \u00a0They arrived with a simple tzatziki sauce that added a refreshing bite to the chips. \u00a0 Definitely would reorder. \u00a0The Keftedes (Meatballs) and Fries Entree was served with rosemary fries. \u00a0The Meatballs were covered in a lightly cooked onion and herb mixture. The Meatballs had a barely-there hint of the flavors you associate with greek meatballs, but not enough to give them any sort of taste. \u00a0 The dish came with five meatballs- \u00a0I had no interest in eating more than one. \u00a0 I rarely eat fries, but compared to the meatballs, the fries were quite welcome.The Roasted Leg of Lamb sandwich was another miss. \u00a0 The description sounded delightful- shaved leg of lamb, arugula, roasted peppers and herbed yogurt. \u00a0 The Lamb was tasteless- you almost thought there was no lamb in each bite. \u00a0 The herbed yogurt would have been a refreshing addition if there was enough to even see it on the sandwich. \u00a0The Fries that accompanied both were listed as \"Rosemary Feta Fries\". \u00a0 The fries were tasty- the rosemary is always a nice addition to fries. SERVICE: \u00a0There were THREE tables occupied (including ours), yet our server took forever to handle simple requests (Silverware, please? So we could eat?). \u00a0 We arrived with the baby just as the venue opened for lunch. \u00a0[I know, I know- this is not typically a baby spot, but my husband and I had a rare moment together, in the area and we both wanted to take another look at the party options here. \u00a0The baby was going to fall asleep in a few minutes anyway and is actually pretty well groomed/mannered for restaurant visits.] \u00a0We were not offered a high chair, nor did we ask for one. \u00a0 I did ask for a baby cup of water with a straw for him. \u00a0The waiter was sweet enough to bring a GLASS shotglass with a straw in it. \u00a0He said he thought it would be perfect for little hands and proudly handed it to my one year old. \u00a0 I had no comment. It was obvious that he had not been exposed to children much so I just giggled and politely asked if he had any plastic cups with or without a lid. \u00a0 Apparently they did not. \u00a0No bother, I thought, as I had water for him in a child appropriate cup.COST: \u00a0Our lunch cost @$42- including the two entrees and appetizer listed above along with two club sodas. \u00a0WILL WE RETURN: Like sirens in ancient mythology that lure sailors with their beauty and music, the trendy ambiance of this venue lures us back each season as we hunt \u00a0for a fun spot to host a party. \u00a0However the food and service always turns us off to this spot and we end up booking elsewhere.", "Date": "2013-11-05", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "Lee T.", "ReviewID": "wRUNdQKtvRfE35vDvsLBGg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great decor modern, very clean, refreshing place, attentive service, great food, especially the seafood", "Date": "2014-05-12", "Author_Location": "Pompano Beach, FL"}, {"Author": "Susan L.", "ReviewID": "nvc-z6WXJHt5vWZ4dFbJDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of our favorite places, Dawson 's tiramisu martini is off the hook.

I felt like I was transported back to Mykonos.The food , the service, everything was amazing. I give thos place a very enthusiastic five stars. Be sure to try the grilled octopus, and the watermelon feta salad. Oh, and the sagankai with shrimp is AMAZING!!!", "Date": "2013-08-31", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "Ronn M.", "ReviewID": "ut7FnB7St7-TPKfYgJP_wg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This new restaurant (opened in August 2012) has received spotty reviews for its spotty service and mostly pricey menu. Those \"reviews\" (posted on insidefortlauderdale.com, which isn't a local website, but owned by a for-profit, commerical company in NY) may or may not be accurate. I'm sure the owners and staff of Thasos are reading what's being written about them, and are tweaking their restaurant. Maybe they'll tweak the menu too, reducing some of the more outrageously priced items, not least of which is the wine list.My suggestion is to order your dinner at Thasos the way Greeks order when they go out. Authenticity has to be the rule of thumb at Greek eateries, and Thasos must be following that strategy. The moussaka and calamari were both cooked to perfection, with perfect seasoning. Neither were overly greasy, a common pitfall of these dishes at ordinary Greek restaurants.It's too bad we weren't able to drink Greek retsina wine with our meal, but $30 for a bottle of pine-flavored white wine is more than twice what that wine is sold for stores who don't want to rip off their customers.The stories you've read about the origins of this taverna arising out of an argument are true. As long as the owner of Thasos wants to put Greek Islands Taverna (a block away from Thasos) out of business, the dining public will benefit from authentic Greek food served by friendly staff in a chic Greek taverna.

A little salty for me. I asked for some olive oil for my bread and they brought me a nice bottle of Terra Medi. Dealing in oil myself by the taste I knew this was northern greek oil. Similiar to the Italian oil. OK for me but most will not notice.We had the lamb on flatbread which was awesome and their dips on boats we just awesome as well.

And finally the Chilean sea bass, excellently cooked and great taste. Finally the dessert, we tried 3 different types. All excellent and great presentation.Over all a great night, place was a little loud as the whole place is stone wall. What a felt lacked was management coming around to greet the people.

You have to piss somebody off pretty bad to want to write a review at midnight.Funny, when we arrived we saw a large table of people from our industry (superyacht) and we went to say hello. Knowing that we are from Fort Lauderdale they asked: \"What do you know of this place?\" and we answered that we were here to find out.Ambiance? Great. Food? very nice. However, when our waiter came at the end of our meal to check on us we mentioned to him that we found a rather long hair in our potatoes. We noticed that the majority of the cook staff had hair nets, so this seemed rather odd.We didn't plan to make a big deal of this, as the food was fine. However, the waiter brought a manager to our table right away.This is where the evening went wrong.The manager, instantly on the defensive, said \"How could a long hair be in our food if all of our people wear hair nets?\" \"I don't know,\" said my husband, \"but that is what we found.\" The rest of the banter is insignificant, suffice it to say that the overly defensive manager had absolutely no interest in hearing that there was indeed a hair found in his food. He was certain that we had \"planted\" (Yes, a word he used) the hair.I don't need to say more. Except that I will not be including Thasos in any positive reviews. As I said to the overly defensive manager: \"It is not only about the food, but the service, and the customer service.\" I was in the service industry once myself, as was my husband. We were taught the following: \"the customer is always right\". Thasos should take a long hard look at its management team. There was a second manager who was sent out when Manager #1 wasn't settling the situation. Manager #2 said to my husband \"If I found a hair in my food, I would send it back immediately\". Well, Mr. Smartypants, the hair was found in the potatoes, something my husband started eating after the lamp chops. Again, insinuating that we were up to some sort of scheme to swindle them out of their $28 lamb chops.Instead, we paid our bill, tipped our waiter 18% and tipped our valet. But that is the first and last time we will be at Thasos. We will continue getting our lamb chops around the corner at the wonderful Greek Taverna Islands as we have been for years. Oh, and for the remainder of our superyacht friends? Well, our recommendation will be for elsewhere.

The beautiful LED colors light up the outside of the building in square blocks of lighting and the theme runs throughout the interior with nice square lighting and square drop lights, this place screams amazing Party whatever the occasion may be. The waitress took our order and kept checking up on us making sure we all were happy and satisfied. \u00a0Most of the table had Prosecco's (Il Fresco Rose), and I had the Karpuso Cocktail which the waiter recommended its Ouzo, Kettle One Vodka, Lemon, Watermelon and Rosemary(14$), it was good and perfect balance of strong and tastefully good accompaniment for the appetizers.

It was amazing not one ounce of chewy and not slapped on with some lemon-sauce like other places, this was again in a delicate Olive oil and let the organic Char-Grill enhance the flavor to the Cephalopod Mollusc ..Truly A Must Try Dish!!

The Fennel Salad was really great the Fennel sliced paper thin again and just a delicious salad I highly recommend it! \u00a0The Thasos Summer salad was cubed Feta a top of watermelon squares and chopped basil on top, the flavors marry together another Great try!Finally (But not Least) Apo Tin Fotia~ From the Fire: \u00a0 \u00a0 Organic Salmon -Lentil Cake, Charred Tomato, Giaourti, Dill (22$)Lavraki- Grilled Whole Mediterranean Sea Bass, Fine Herbs, Lemon,Thasos Olive Oil(28$). \u00a0 \u00a0 Split Roasted Chicken- Mizthra Dumpling, Lemon (16$)Lamb Chops- Crunchy Fingerling Potatoes, Thasos Oregano, Lemon (26$)The Salmon was Delicious and Organic makes all the difference with fish.
