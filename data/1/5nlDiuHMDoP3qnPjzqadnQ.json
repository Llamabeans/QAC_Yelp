You can bring in your own vegan cheese. I'm sure you can bring in your own vegan toppings too! I ordered the no cheese pie, Centi Anini, with veggies and I was quite disappointed. It's not your average local pizza pie but I wasn't feeling the crust. I also ordered the Merilu pizza al metro with no cheese and a topping of arugula. I chose this pie because the honey and truffle oil stood out to me but I didn't even taste a hint of truffle oil. The sweetness of the honey was obvious but the truffle oil was drawing a blank. I like how the pears with walnuts gave it a nice crunch to balance the honey. I figured the pie didn't need sauce with those bold flavors but I was wrong. When I placed the order, he kept saying so it's going to be basically a crust with honey, pears, walnuts and arugula and I kept replying yes. I asked for sauce on the side after a few bites; it was free of charge and it saved the dry pie a lot. The sauce was surprisingly warm. Based on the pictures I assumed the crust would have been better - something similar to brick oven crust but crunchier. This small joint is so friendly! The customer service is amazing! They check up on you quite often and ask you how everything is and if we need anything additional.

Merilu is not a drunk dollar slice place, as it definitely costs more than $1 but boasts fresh, quality ingredients in a cozily decorated shop.Their pizza is long and rectangular, with a lovely thin and crispy crust (which somehow does not get soggy) and boasts the perfect ratio of dough to toppings. Everything is thinly sliced and thinly layered, but will leave you satisfied without feeling greasy or inundated.I highly recommend:- La Fresca (fresh tomatoes & fresh basil)- Rustica (Italian sausage, onion & peppers)- Cardinale (fresh cut mushrooms & thinly sliced ham)- Catalina (the sliced breaded eggplant is paper thin and not heavy at all)- Wild Child (the ricotta is such a fresh contrast to the jalapeno)Whether it's for delivery, eat-in, or take out, you can rest assured that the quality of the food will remain the same, as each pie is made from scratch right in front of your eyes on a marble slab behind the counter. If you get it by the slice, it's most likely fresh out of the oven (less than half hour ago) and they will toast it again for you to ensure the right crunch for the crust.

I walked into this place and was dumbstuck by pizza so pretty I had to admire the pies before I ordered. This is artisanal thin crust at its finest, with fresh quality ingredients and just beautifully made. The pies here are oblongs, and you get a slice that is squarish. Pick your toppings..mushroom, artichoke..when I went there must have been at least 10 different flavors to choose from in addition to the plain margherita. Everything here is cooked just right, to the crispy crust, to the sweetish tomato sauce, to the fresh mozzarella. You pay a little more but you are getting the best. For those with hearty appetites, it will be easy for you to polish off three slices. Merilu also sells Panini, salad and pastaThis is a small place, immaculate with exposed brick walls and not too much seating. So if you come at peak, be prepared to take your pizza to go. This is a family run place with the pride and friendliness that comes from good management and exceptional customer service. The lady behind the counter was the daughter, and pointed out her brother making pizza behind her. She was delighted I remembered her from the Yelp Pizza event in the Church on Houston St. My sis and I had been searching for the place that served up artfully decorated squares to the left and back of the church. After tasting the pizza here, I thought it could be Merilu. This is such a lovely place with great pizza and enthusiastic service, you will immediately recommend it to family and friends, as I did.

So why the one star you ask? \u00a0Well, on today, Tues, 4/15 (yep TAX day) we placed an order (GRUBHUB # 58554487) for four orders of Polla Alla Parmigiana (chick'n parm) and requested angel hair pasta or spaghetti on the side for each. \u00a0** Please note, pasta is NOT included with this dish, which is why it was ordered on the side. \u00a0 However, when opening the chick'n parm, there was no pasta and after searching the other bags (salads and bread) there were no separate containers of pasta either. \u00a0See, I know it comes separately, because we ordered the chick'n parm the same way, just the week before, with NO problem. \u00a0I called Merilu's to let them know of the oversight and a guy that says his name was DAVID proceeded to tell me their chick'n parm does not come with pasta. \u00a0I explained to him, I understood that however I asked for angel hair pasta or spaghetti on the side. \u00a0The same as I ordered the previous week and I received spaghetti, on the side with my order. \u00a0DAVID becomes somewhat agitated and tells me they don't carry angel hair pasta-- **(stop trying to be RIGHT and LISTEN to your customer-- you know the little people that come in to order your from your establishment, so you can stay in business). \u00a0I repeat, I placed the order the same as I did the previous week and received spaghetti. \u00a0I think he finally heard me, but wanting to get me off the phone, asks me what do I want him to do about it. \u00a0I'm a little thrown back with that statement and I told him I just want the spaghetti delivered as soon as possible. \u00a0He tells me its going to take some time, and quickly corrects himself and says it's going to be a while. \u00a0He has to wait for the deliver guy to come back to check the ticket, and \"who knows how long that will be.\" \u00a0I tell him I have the grubhub order number could he just check that, I'm repeating exactly what was put on the order. \u00a0He insists he has to wait on the delivery guy and it's going to be a while. \u00a0 \u00a0At this point, I become beyond just mildly irritated and asked if he is the manager and he tells me no-- \"I just work here\". \u00a0 I state, \"obviously, since this is no longer about the pasta, this as become a customer service issue. \u00a0Your tone as well as your lack of proper customer services skills are apparent.\" \u00a0Of course, we go thru 'who's the manager? what's the manager's name? etc.' \u00a0When I asked DAVID when would the manager be in, he says \"he comes and goes whenever he feels like it.\" I asked how would Uciano, (that's the manager) feel once he learns what he thinks of his work ethic and of course DAVID proceeds to tell me, \"I don't know, you should ask him when you talk to him.\" \u00a0I see this is now a joke to DAVID. \u00a0At this point, I realize I'm speaking with someone that cares very little for the establishment he works for and even less regarding his own employment. \u00a0He's probably bounced around from one restaurant after the next, with his insolent and rude demeanor. \u00a0Who knows who DAVID really is and if that's his real name. \u00a0He may very well have been the manager, and if so-- Merilu's won't survive if their employees take on DAVID's attitude in regards to their customers. \u00a0All it takes is one BAD apple to spoil the whole bunch. \u00a0SMHI refuse to spend my hard earned money (or my company's corporate expense) on a business that thinks that poorly of their customers. \u00a0Too bad, I really liked their homemade balsamic vinaigrette....", "Date": "2014-04-15", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "David C.", "ReviewID": "HPF2dfgVgyFcD4Ki_QkqNw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Merrily is part of the hipster restaurant row in Hells Kitchen.

The staff were very nice on the phone and had no problem letting me substitute ingredients. Garlic bread. JUST DO IT! Really thinly sliced and heavily buttered/oiled. Ridiculously good. Garlic isn't overly intense and its has other seasoning as well. Really good value for $3. It is so good I easily eat a whole loaf by myself, order multiple! Pizza Merilu - Gorgonzola cheese with thinly sliced pears and walnuts. OMG this pizza is freaking bomb!!!!! I've tried similar style at quite a few places, this here it seems to be toned down by being blended with ricotta. The texture and slight sweetness of the pear really pairs well with the cheese. Walnuts are fresh, go surprisingly well too, adding just the perfect amount of bite/crunch. My boyfriend doesn't normally really eat Gorgonzola, pears or walnuts (individually, let alone all together! lol) BUT he actually really liked it! He didn't even get to try it fresh, he had it room temperature several hours later after I had mustered every drop of self control in my body not to eat it all, and trekked with the remaining slices from Midtown to Flushing, Queens back to him!

The slices were in disarray like both pies had been dropped, but were were all very hungry and willing to overlook that.

Almost no sauce.2) The thin crust was hard, burnt and tasteless3) The cheese was applied very sparingly and large sections had none at all4) All the toppings were fine, but none stood outThe taste resembled that of a cardboard pizza box more than it did a good NY style pizza.

NY Pizzeria Suprema (great all around slice. Great sauce, great cheese, decent crust. \u00a0We had a bonus slice of the mozzarella/basil and it was one of the best slices ever).2.) Rosa's Pizza (decent slice, but not amazing. \u00a0Crust was good. \u00a0Our bonus slice of the buffalo chicken was far better.3.) Two Boots (we were very excited about this slice after some major disappointments, but the saucy was just too tangy and different to be a good NY slice. \u00a0Sauce wasn't marinara, but cheese and cornmeal crust were good. \u00a0Their fancy slices were pretty good looking though).4.) Fat Sal's (this one was decent, but didn't have as much taste as we expected. \u00a0Looked so much like a perfect NY slice that I almost cried after my first bite and was disappointed).5.) Sacco (another middle of the line slice. \u00a0Cheese was very good, sauce was non-existent).6.) Merilu (this one was a major disappointment. \u00a0I am sure their fancy slices are amazing, but the plain margarita was not anything special. \u00a0Sparse cheese, a very tangy sauce that was not flavorful, and a tasteless crust). \u00a0Definitely not a top 5 place.In conclusion, other than the fact that I want to throw up after all this pizza, I would have to say that if you are in the mood for a slice of pizza in midtown, other than Pizzeria Suprema, you're pretty much out of luck. \u00a0You're no worse off by just going to a $.99 pizza stall.", "Date": "2013-08-14", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Christopher R.", "ReviewID": "tTXcKHZ7jK4cn0s07-IujA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nothing to blow you away but they do a solid, rustic-style slice.
