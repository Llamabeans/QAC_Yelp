I loved this appetizer! The acidity of everything went so well with the tangy, melted feta cheese. The achiovy took this dish to another level though, loved it! great portion size as well, definitely not cheating you out)*grilled octopus, bean salad (HOLD THE PHONE! the grilled octopus had such an amazing tenderness to it, it was meaty, soft and not tough at all like some other places that overcook their octopus. such a great smokey flavor from the grill. the bean salad with the vinaigrette complimented the seafood so well. could eat this all day!)*sheep's milk dumplings (the dumplings were amazing!!!!!! they were like marshmallows in a bath of garlicky, tomatoey goodness. I loved the texture of the dumplings, so soft and fluffy. the spicy lamb sausage was so good!! can definitely taste the lamb meat but it wasn't gamey at all; the sausage was small and chopped into small rounds that was found throughout the dish; the sauce was absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!!! please ask for more bread to soak it up, don't waste this sauce!!!!! this dish is such a comfort food; it's filling but not overwhelming like heavy pasta dishes)This place is adorable with their decor. The entrance is nice with the bar area and the formal dining area is cozy. Service is good and friendly. The bathroom is surprisingly so clean haha. In regards to their food, such great quality and so fresh.

The answer with Kefi is no, here's why...we thought the food was ok, \u00a0but not memorable, but the experience they delivered was just bland and plain boring.First the good: ..appetizers- the Cypriot salad was a refreshing, very enjoyable light summer salad, \u00a0the grilled octopus is good- not chewy, perfect char, with a touch of lemon. Service was efficient and pleasant. Ok so what is not to like? The main dishes we ordered were clumsily presented, over stuffed with chips, and a soggy salad like you would get at a college food truck. The entrees- chicken souvlaki and the lamb burger were just ok. Our biggest dislike was the way the restaurant looked and was laid out. Tables jammed together, hard services, little in the way of decor that reminds you that you are eating at a Greek Restaurant, in other words it has ZERO Greek charm, soul or ambiance. To make matters worse, we were sent to the Kefi basement to eat (even though there were plenty of open tables upstairs). And no surprise here, the Kefi basement smells like ....a musty basement. Also, when sitting downstairs, expect to be in very close proximity with other people (who were banished to the musty basement), and expect to watch the kitchen staff move dirty dishes back and forth while you eat. I mean it was a saddest spot, bleak and bland...not even a little candle to cheer us up. Needless to say, we skipped desert to go up for air.", "Date": "2014-07-06", "Author_Location": "Providence, RI"}, {"Author": "Kristen T.", "ReviewID": "bQkxA6jt7lv7YkpP8_yQ5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This restaurant is a great place to go, especially if you're from a place without good Greek food-- like me.

Cool... But she didn't tell us where to wait or if we got a buzzer or how it would work when it was our turn to be sat. Very awkward.

Anyways... I asked where to go and she said we can have a seat at the bar or go outside. We went to the bar and sat there...we were going to order drinks from the bartender and pay for them upfront before we got sat but the bartender was clearly under the impression that we were just taking up seats in her bar while waiting for our table because she never even looked at us...awkward again because If we didn't want drinks we would of waited outside for our table.We got our table in about 15min which was nice but then to cut this review short....we got sat next to a table that was being very rude to the waiter and so therefore, the waiter came to our table to take our order and drop off drinks ONCE...he stayed away from our area because of the other table...with that being said...you can imagine how asking for the check and paying out went...not well.

Many of my friends had recommended the place to me. So, I was thrilled when I managed to secure a reservation last Friday night. Maybe its because the place had been so hyped, but I wasn't overly impressed with my meal. It was good... but nothing I would run back for. The grilled octopus was probably the best dish we tried. But, the rapine was waaay too oily and my simple grilled fish also tasted bathed in oil and butter. The special pasta dish made with a pulled pork was also pretty darn good, but its not that hard to get a good pasta dish in this city.It was also packed that night and we felt a bit rushed by the waitstaff, but that's understandable on a Friday night, and forgivable.

The main dishes we ordered were clumsily presented, over stuffed with chips, and a soggy salad like you would get at a college food truck. The entrees- chicken souvlaki and the lamb burger were just ok. Our biggest dislike was the way the restaurant looked and was laid out.

To make matters worse, we were sent to the Kefi basement to eat (even though there were plenty of open tables upstairs). And no surprise here, the Kefi basement smells like ....a musty basement. Also, when sitting downstairs, expect to be in very close proximity with other people (who were banished to the musty basement), and expect to watch the kitchen staff move dirty dishes back and forth while you eat.

The menu seems more casual than MP Taverna. Once again my wife and I ordered more than we should have. Grilled Octopus with Bean Salad: I couldn't help but compare the grilled octopus here with MP Taverna's. Both have a perfectly soft texture inside but the one at Kefi was over charred. Some people may like this version, but I think there is an ideal amount of char that makes a dish taste great and anything above that is overkill. Still very good though. 4/5Sweetbreads, spinach, shallots, garlic: \u00a0I love sweetbreads - especially chunky, mouthful of sweetbreads. \u00a0The spinach gave the dish good balance and the fried shallots provided the texture. 4/5Chef's app plate: This wasn't on the menu but since we mentioned Kefi on Facebook, we got a free app from the kitchen. The app plate consisted of four kinds of dipping sauce: chickpeas, tzatziki, caviar and eggplant. They were all good. I was surprised by how much mint there was in the chickpeas but it tasted refreshing. The tzatziki was among some of the best I've had. 4/5Flat pasta, pulled braised rabbit, graviera cheese: I realized that I'm not a huge fan of graviera cheese because it's a bit too sweet and fruity for my liking but the braised rabbit was so good that it didn't bother me too much. The pasta was thin, wide and flat. It's hard to maintain the texture for this kind of pasta but they were able to. A light tomato sauce brought the dish together 4/5Sheep's milk dumplings, tomato, pine nuts, spicy lamb sausage: \u00a0This was my favorite dish of the night but I'm partial to all things spicy. All the flavors were bold and the spicy lamb sausage was basically very good quality merguez. There was a lot of tomato sauce present throughout this dish which paired very well with the sausage and the excellent dumplings. 5/5After eating so much food, we obviously didn't have room for dessert, but much of the dessert menu looked similar to MP Taverna's so we left with no regret. \u00a0The restaurant is pretty casual but downstairs, where we sat, it was better to come in a group of 4 than 2 because of the way the tables were spaced.

With Michael Psilakis, one of the forefront chefs in Greek cuisine, heading the kitchen, all it took was a quick skim of the menu before I promptly made a reservation for brunch.Conveniently located next to both 86th Street Stations (the 1 and A/B/C), Kefi has one of the most deceptive entrances. The actual doorway is extremely narrow and easy to pass by, but enter, and you'll set eyes on a large, high-ceiling dining room with far too many tables to count. Even better, Kefi has a lower level that can accommodate larger parties and serves as venue for private events. We were quickly seated at a two-top near the front and given the brunch and specials menu. For those that enjoy it, Kefi does offer a \"bottomless brunch\" option, which gives diners a (hypothetically) unlimited number of glasses of mimosa, sangria, or bloody mary's to accompany their meal.We started off with an order of the Albondigas, a traditional Spanish meatball dish that was given a few splashes of Greek cuisine. The meatballs (4 pieces) were tender and full of flavor, a combination of ground pork and lamb seasoned with plenty of garlic, parsley, and dill. The tomato sauce that came with it had the requisite Italian garnishes of onions, garlic, and bay leaves, with a hint of red wine, but also came strewn with tsakistes and kalamata olives. It wasn't a pairing I initially would have thought of, but the tartness and slight bitterness from this addition complimented the dish well.For the main course, we opted to share two of Kefi's signature dishes: the Kefi burger and the Sheep's Milk Dumplings. The burger was one of the better ones I've had; there's some brisket mixed into the beef, which adds an additional layer of juiciness into the patty. Cooked to a medium rare, topped with a generous layer of feta cheese, and finally sandwiched between two halves of ciabatta, it's an impressive piece of work, especially when paired with a Greek salad and a pile of french fries on the side. The Sheep's Milk Dumplings were also a solid dish, though one that seemed as though it had been hastily conceived. It's a Greek pasta dish, featuring a pillowy, gnocchi-like dumpling accompanied by pine nuts, spicy lamb sausage, spinach, and a healthy dose of garlic, all cooked in a robust tomato sauce and finished off with crumbled feta cheese. It reminded me more of a casserole than an actual pasta dish, but the ingredients paired well together and made for a hearty meal.Across the board, Kefi is a solid restaurant and it's no wonder that so many, locals and non-locals, were delighted to hear of its reopening.

Even if you are not a fan of lamb you should try your friend/spouse/partner/family's order of lamb burger.

I've also never had another lamb burger as succulent and juicy as this one. It comes with a side salad and potato chips, and while the former is a fresh, light compliment to the burger, the chips are nothing special.Then, of course, get the octopus over chickpeas. I'm a fan of all seafood in general, but I don't think I've ever had grilled octopus as soft and tender as Kefi's. It was generously seasoned (a bit too salty for me but probably perfect for the average palate), flavorful, and has beautiful grill marks. The sheep's milk dumplings + spicy lamb sausage + pine nuts was also really yummy! I've never had anything like it before - not exactly gnocchi, not exactly a \"dumpling,\" but so soft and melty. The lamb sausage was the perfect companion to up the flavor component, and was in a realm of its own and different from the lamb burger.If you call ahead to make a reservation, you'll get seated in the spacious, well-lit downstairs portion of the restaurant, which, in my opinion, beats the darker, noisier, and colder upstairs portion.

The answer with Kefi is no, here's why...we thought the food was ok, \u00a0but not memorable, but the experience they delivered was just bland and plain boring.First the good: ..appetizers- the Cypriot salad was a refreshing, very enjoyable light summer salad, \u00a0the grilled octopus is good- not chewy, perfect char, with a touch of lemon. Service was efficient and pleasant. Ok so what is not to like? The main dishes we ordered were clumsily presented, over stuffed with chips, and a soggy salad like you would get at a college food truck. The entrees- chicken souvlaki and the lamb burger were just ok. Our biggest dislike was the way the restaurant looked and was laid out. Tables jammed together, hard services, little in the way of decor that reminds you that you are eating at a Greek Restaurant, in other words it has ZERO Greek charm, soul or ambiance. To make matters worse, we were sent to the Kefi basement to eat (even though there were plenty of open tables upstairs). And no surprise here, the Kefi basement smells like ....a musty basement. Also, when sitting downstairs, expect to be in very close proximity with other people (who were banished to the musty basement), and expect to watch the kitchen staff move dirty dishes back and forth while you eat. I mean it was a saddest spot, bleak and bland...not even a little candle to cheer us up.

I also had a glass of red sangria which was awful, it reminded me of a cheap juice I drank when I was little.The food is worth checking out as long as they keep the idea of quality, not quantity in mind. Also, make a reservation, this place gets packed fast!", "Date": "2014-02-18", "Author_Location": "Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Adam W.", "ReviewID": "aKfv1029XInkpy2T1sDR2g", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The food is not bad; it is no longer consistent and good. \u00a0The selection is still ...

Not pretentious and the staff was very nice and friendly. The manager also came up to us during our meal to make sure everything was okay and if we needed anything.The give bread at the table however since the bread is out before you sit down and seems to have been there for a bit, it was rock hard. We asked for fresher bread which they provided with no problem.We ordered the goat cheese dumplings with spicy lamb sausage-the sauce was very good and the dumplings were soft and pillowy and yummy. The only negative of the dish was the lamb sausage which was very hard and tasted funny.We also ordered the chicken sandwich and the chickpea fritter sandwich. Both were good and came with homemade chips and salad. Con: salad was a bit limp and overly covered with dressing.Overall, a good dining experience- you can be in and out in under an hour.

I came here for dinner one night with the hubby and was not pleased. You'd think they have an amazing menu because the wait was about 45 minutes for a Thursday night but it really was not so impressive.Husband had the chicken souvlaki sandwich which he said was really dry. I would have thought they'd have more souvlaki options on the menu (like a platter with sides versus a sandwich) and found the menu limited. I ordered the branzino which was very good but extremely oily. There was so much olive oil on that thing that I felt pretty disgusting at the end of it. We had a crappy table in the middle of the restaurant and kept getting pushed around by rushed waiters. Not the best experience.
