I know the place is owned by an immigrant family, and service in some asian(also Europe) countries is not expected to be at the level of the US. But with that said, I have traveled in the Philippines, Korea, Thailand, UK, mainland Europe, Japan, etc., and never experienced service this pathetic. When you get the waiter to your table, order everything because you aint seeing him again until you get the bill. I should mention, both times I had to go to the counter to ask for the bill despite ringing the bell on the table several times.The second visit was the clincher. My wife ordered the bbq, where they bring the grill to the table and you cook it yourself. One of the staff had the nerve to come over and turn off the grill because the party behind us complained. Firstly, don't have the bbq if your ventilation sucks. Second, don't expect that passive display of disrespect to dissuade a guy like me... I cranked it back up and cooked that shit well done. It was either that or walk out without paying... which was an option. Never again will I go to this dump.

However the server returned and we were told they were out of materials for the kimichi jji gae so we switched to S7 (doen jang jji gae). The food arrived fairly quickly and came with about 10 ban chan dishes. But sadly there wasn't any steamed eggs this time (which was included 2 years ago). The soup dishes arrived piping hot and was served in a hot clay bowl. The spicy broth was pretty flavorful with good consistency. My dish had bits of seafood like octopus, clams, and shrimp. The seafood wasn't overcooked or too chewy. The K11 dish arrived a bit later. It's basically a spicy marinated pork and kimchi dish served with steamed/boil tofu triangles. The pork was had great flavor and the tofu went well with the dish. It also help calm the spiciness of the dish. We both managed to finish our soup dishes but we barely ate 1/4 of the K11 dish.

We enter and take our seats, a cool call-bell was attached to our table, at first I didn't know what it was, then we asked. You know what they say, ask and you shall receive. Our waiter was quick and friendly. I had the Bi Bim Bop and it was a lot of food, but not all that great, it's hard to mess this up. The taste just wasn't there. They say you're body goes through a cycle, or complete change every ten years or so. Right before I turned 30 was my change. I used to love not and spicy cuisine. I just can't do it anymore. I remember before I was 20 I couldn't eat so much as Franks Red Hot without my mouth burning. Before I knew it I was eating a 7-8 on the Thai menus. Mexican. The hotter the better, now that palate is no longer available for me, my tummy doesn't like it. Maybe when I'm 40 I'll be back in the game. When that happens I'll check this place out again, if it still exists, keep messin up Bi Bim Bop, I can assure you won't be. In the middle of the floor, in the worst spot in the whole restaurant was a table bearing a reserved sign on it. It gave off the idea that it was some presidential reservation, yet it was in the lowest of peasants coordinates, maybe I'm out of the loop. It was good for a laugh though.

I've often had the stigma of being Caucasians in an Asian restaurant and not being experts on the cuisine and either getting poor quality help due to language barriers or poor quality help due to being an outsider. Here the staff was friendly, well-spoken, and knew exactly how to help some Caucasians that didn't quite know what they wanted.Our waitress suggested a seafood noodle soup that she assured us would be excellent for leftovers, and I knew I wanted some good beef so I opted for the ribeye to grill at the table. The soup was loaded with noodles, vegetables, and tons of whole shrimp, mussels, and squid all cooked perfectly.The BBQ came out on a nice flat skillet with a small portable propane grill underneath. The ribeye was extremely tendered and well flavored, served with a raw onion to grill alongside and the traditional banchan. Every single one, from the fish cakes to the eggplant, were tasty and just the right bit to accompany our meat. Fresh romaine and a bowl of rice came as usual, but the kicker was a miso-broth based soup that I have no idea what was in it aside from tofu but it was delicious and an unexpected star of the meal.All of that was under $40 and gave us 2 days worth of leftovers. The restaurant was clean and inviting and the menu had plenty on it to make it worth coming back. The only complaint I can say is that it's a bit difficult to find, being on the 2nd floor of the Asian Town Center.

It is on the 2nd floor of Asian Town Center. Once inside, the restaurant is small, clean and inviting.

At my last visit, they even offered to replace our meal if we were not satisfied. The door bell on the table is also nice to have, but can attract attention from everyone in the restaurant if used. Food: Not bad.- Pros: Usually I order my usual S15 Bi Bim Bap when I come. Very filling! The crunchy rice from the sizzling hot pot is my favorite!! \u00a0My BF ordered the mackerel, which was overall fresh and pretty well priced. It even came with a seafood soy paste soup.- Cons: \u00a0The small dishes offered fluctuate in quality and quantity. At my last visit, we only were given 6 dishes, we usually get at least 8. One dish was not even edible bc of how spicy it was. I was also disappointed that they did not have tea automatically served for you. You have to ask, or you just get water. The Korean rice tea is one of the joys of Korean dining. Overall: I would come back when craving late night Korean food.

That being said, I had probably the worst experience of my life at Miega. Let me get the issues with service out of the way before discussing the food. First, It took ten minutes for receive menus after being seated, to say nothing of drinks. When we got our menus, the server dashed away from the table without asking if we needed anything, or bringing waters. We should have taken that as a sign, but we'd been told the food was good, so we decided to tough it out. Everything from then on was a chore. Getting watre and tea, refills water and tea, placing our order, receiving our order, where the f**k is our banchan, etc. The service here is a shining example of a spectacular failure.The food was boring at best, offensively bad at worst. After waiting for about half an hour, my boyfriend and I were finally able to place our order: a seafood pancake for an appetizer, bibimbap for my main, and a spicy pork dish for his. The seafood pancake took 20-30 minutes to come out, the bibimbap followed in about 10 minutes, and the spicy pork took another 10 minutes. I felt bad for my boyfriend. The seafood pancake was pretty much inedible. What it lacked in flavor, it made up for in grease. He couldn't eat it. I was starving, so I had a couple of pieces, and was really thankful when my bibimbap came out. Well, at least until I tasted it. It was the most bland, flavorless bibimbap I'd ever had. Let's be real here: bibimbap is rice with vegetables and meat on top. How is it possible to f**k that up? Miega found a way. The gojuchang that came with it tasted like ketchup. Disgusting. My boyfriend was still waiting for his pork, looking hungry and cranky. When it finally came out, it was missing a pretty crucial component: rice! It took about five minutes to flag down a server to ask. Then we waited, and waited, and asked again, and waited.... The rice never showed up. Who serves a stir fried dish without rice? The dish itself was as bland as everything else, and doused in that same ketchupy gojuchang. By this point, my boyfriend didn't even care... he was just happy to finally have some food in front of him.Oh, and did I mention this place is friggin' expensive? $45 for lunch for two. To summarize: We were there for two hours, had the most inattentive service of our lives, had a really bad lunch, and still had to drop nearly $50.

Each table has a bell service option which I find awesome and rare in Cleveland. So anytime you need something, just ring the bell and someone would come attend you. On to the food, this place has a great selection to choose from. From your traditional appetizers such as Korean dumplings and Ddukkbokki, they also had a Chinese-Korean dishes like Jjangmyun that I like so much and Korean BBQ! This place has it all and the prices were a bit pricey but the portions were plentiful. We ordered their ddukbokki and tried it for the first time. I was disappointed due to the lack of taste. In other words, it was mainly all of the rice cakes in a pool of tasteless red chili paste. It wasn't hot enough and maybe I have a standard from eating from Seoul but I was not a big fan of their version whatsoever. There were fish cakes, onions in the dish but when it comes to Korean food, the chili paste is everything. For the main entree, I ordered their jjangmyun and this was exceptionally tasteful.

Since cutting most meat out of my diet, I had very rarely looked back... until it came time to go to a Korean BBQ with friends. It was the first time I found myself longingly craving meat. The bulgogi and samgupsal and even kimchi jigae was now pretty much off-limits.However, I discovered that Miega is by far the most accomodating Korean restaurant in Cleveland when it comes to non-carnivores. It is not on the menu, but if they have the ingredients, they will make the most beautiful, delicious platter of vegetarian gim-bap (Korean sushi) with freshly cooked fried eggs. The kimchi jigae is already made vegetarian (the pork is added after the stew cooks, so it's easy to omit). My husband ordered vegetarian bibimbap and they left out the bulgogi and added tofu in one of the most beautifully-arranged bibimbaps I've ever seen!I occasionally eat fish, and this is the place to have it! The grilled mackerel is delicious with rice and kimchi. All of the banchan items that are served before the entrees have been delicious! \u00a0 The servers are wonderful - I always enjoy trying to use the very, very small amount of conversational Korean I know with them, and they are happy to humor me and offer pronunciation help. Tip: Another great thing about Miega (I hope/think) \u00a0is that it is BYOB. We have brought a bottle of wine to dinner there a couple times. When I visited Korea, drinking soju with every meal was customary - I now tend to feel like any Korean dinner (well, I guess any dinner) seems more festive with a bottle shared with friends.", "Date": "2012-07-19", "Author_Location": "Cleveland, OH"}, {"Author": "Christine L.", "ReviewID": "DKztG4oK5mPqloS60adDNg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This spot definitely has *better Korean food than other places in Cle.

Miega is the lone business. The inside has an updated look with warm colors. We got there fairly early (5pm) and there were a few people, but more people came in through the night (5-6 more tables?)

The rice got REALLY crispy, which was amazing! Mmm. The galbi was ok. I think it wasn't as soft as it could have been and the cut seemed a little thick. I also tried the kimchi jigae. I'm more sensitive to spiciness, but my friends said it was a little tame for the spicy ones they've had in the past.I guess the reason Miega is a 3 is because we are still on a quest for really good MEAT.

You actually need to turn on 38th Ave. and then turn into the parking lot of the grocery store. When you go in, go up the stairs and you'll see Miega. Miega seemed to be the only store upstairs, but I didn't really look around. It looks as though the building is being remodeled and maybe there will be more restaurants/stores coming soon. First off, I think that the name of their restaurant is misleading. The reason i decided to come to Miega vs the other Korean restaurants in town was because I was expecting a Korean BBQ with a grill at each table where you can grill your own meat. \u00a0I was a little disappointed to see this was a Korean restaurant not a Korean BBQ. There were no built in grills at any of the tables. I honestly think I should give this restaurant a 2 star rating because I was very disappointed that it was not an actual Korean BBQ! Very misleading!! Change your name!As far as Korean restaurants go, it's not a really fancy restaurant but seemed like a clean, quick place to grab a bite to eat. There was a large screen where you could watch Korean TV.Food:The bahn chan (side dishes) were pretty good but they didn't offer us any refills. (But we didn't ask for refills either). They had a lot of the typical bahn chan like kimchi, bean sprouts (kong nah mool), fish cakes (odeng). I really liked their pickled hot peppers and the small little korean pancakes. \u00a0For the meal, we got the Galbi dolsot bibimbap and the Jja jang myun. The galbi in the bibimbap was pretty tasty but it didn't seem like there was much of a variety for the vegetables in the bibimbap. As for the Jjajangmyun, it was sweeter than what I'm used to. \u00a0It also seemed that the noodles were dry noodles that they boiled as opposed to the fresh dough ones. (Although I may be mistaken). There were also a LOT of onion and not much meat in the sauce. Definitely not the best jjajangmyun that I've had but better some places. I decided to give Miega a 3 start rating because the banchan was pretty good, the service was good, the waitress was nice and attentive (but then again there were hardly any other people in the restaurant), and overall the food was ok for the price.", "Date": "2011-09-20", "Author_Location": "Toledo, OH"}, {"Author": "Rick M.", "ReviewID": "g77y1LkXkST1K2APUqu1gQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice lunch.

I was expecting grill tables (a la Seoul Hot Pot) due to the namesake (Korean BBQ) but was left a little disappointed when not one was in sight. The place was packed to the brim on a Saturday night, and the service was very friendly although not very dependable.We made reservations but still had to wait about 20 minutes, which wasn't much of an issue since most of our party was late. Our table had a nifty little button on it that allowed us to summon our server. It wasn't as effective as we hoped because it took a while for the server to get to us, but it's nice to know they give customers the ability. \u00a0We had a big party so our server was a little confused with our orders and we had to go around a number of times. They also missed one of our orders.We had a decent array of banchan, most of which tasted very good, but still can't hold a candle to the wide selection Seoul Garden offers. \u00a0We started off with \"Gu Man Du\" (fried dumplings), which tasted phenomenal. For the main entree, I ended up ordering Bok Eum (octopus, squid, veggies in a VERY spicy sauce). I was a little disappointed they didn't offer Tteokbokki, which I thought was a traditional dish and figured this would be similar. I will just say that this dish is EXTREMELY spicy with not much other flavor to it at all. I love spicy Korean but if it just feels like I'm putting spoonfuls of red chili paste in my mouth then it's not much of a meal. I was sweating and my mouth was on fire. I wouldn't order it again.Others in my party ordered: - Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap, which did taste great- some spicy pork dish I can't remember the name of, but it tasted JUST like my dish except with pork- noodles in a stir fried black bean paste, which was a bit different to me but accurately prepared according to the one who ordered it and loved itOverall, I wasn't impressed but didn't think it was too bad.

Even though I actually liked their frozen dumplings, it wasn't even fully cooked when they brought it out. It was fine after we soaked it in the soup for a while, but that was not the most pleasant experience when you want some nice warm soup. Also, their hotpot combo dish isn't the best in the world.

Chewy beef and spam, not exactly what I had in mind just reading their descriptions.However, they do a very nice job with the pork bellies. It came out sliced really thin.

Last time, the AWESOME food made up for the sub-par service. This time, the service made up for the sub-par food. I guess I was expecting a lot given my past experience.. We ordered \u00a0steamed dumplings, Jjamppong, which is a spicy seafood noodle soup dish, and tang-soo-yook (sweet and sour pork). First off, the dumplings were probably some of the best I've had. They make it fresh, all hand made and lucky for us, they actually made them that day. It was just awesome. Everything a dumpling should be :) For the jjamppong, I was quite disappointed to see how not spicy it was. It had a LOT of seafood in it which was really nice, but the broth was really missing in its spiciness. Where was the kick I experienced with the ddeokbokki? The noodles could be more chewy, as they seemed a bit too soft to be used for that particular dish. Perhaps I can ask them to make it spicier? But seriously, I'm not that good at eating spicy things yet I could not feel anything spicy-wise at all. :/ Bummer-. On to the sweet and sour pork. Well...this... I mean.. The dish looked really good. It had all the elements of a good sweet and sour pork (a bit on the Korean-Chinese food style).. But the pork smelled. Quite a bit. The pieces of meat was quite big and it could have been awesome aside from the smell. I'm not that sensitive to meat smells so if it was to a degree that I could smell it, I'm really not sure how other more sensitive people might have felt eating that dish. The tempura coating became soggy within a few minutes, which you really don't expect on a sweet and sour dish. It should have stayed crunchy for at least the length of the time we were dining, which was around 30 minutes or so. Major turn off there too. The sweet and sour sauce itself was way way too sweet, so at the end, it was a hunk of smelly pork covered in soggy tempura coating in a sickeningly sweet sauce. Seriously, will probably not order again. :/So... All in all, I'll definitely return to Miega for the dumplings, ddeokbokki and pa-jun. I did make it my goal to at least try most of their dishes, so we'll see how that goes. I do wish some of the dishes cost a bit less..but... well, I guess Korean restaurants are on the scarce side..
