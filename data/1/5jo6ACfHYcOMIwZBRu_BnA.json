The food all sounded good, but the prices were higher than they should be for sharable plates. I came with colleagues from my Detroit office, and they seemed to be happy with their food - and from where I sat, it looked delicious. I had the fried green tomatoes (so worth the 7 Weight Watchers points), and made a change to the eggplant and portobello sliders. I had them without the bun, and without the mushrooms, so it was just eggplant and mozzarella. Two of the three of us had soft drinks, and so the bill pre-tip came to just under $40. The food was great, the service was just OK, and so for that it gets 4 stars.

Pro: The staff is helpful and pleasant with sunbeams radiating from their smiles.

Bad form, Small Plates.Pro: The bill was inexpensive because a friend, drunk on ego and moderately priced wine, slipped the waitress his card in a foolish attempt to impress her while the rest of us argued about who had the nicest abdominal muscles at the table. Con: A friend lifted up his shirt to reveal his abdominal muscles, and much to my dismay, wasn't removed from the establishment by the manager, thus ruining the dining experience for the other patrons primarily because his abs were in fact that of a Greek God.

Also when you sit outside you often feel neglected if its full inside. They only have 2 tv, so if you gappen in during a game you probably wont get to see anything unless you are lucky enough to get a bar seat and want one.Other then that, if you get in, food is great. A bit more then what it should really cost, but the quality is stellar. \u00a0Sweet potato fries- I mean so good. Pizzas and salads are always full of flavor and great. The fish tacos were a great addition. The only thing is they really shouldn't use tilapia for the cost.

The food is my cup of tea. Order a ton of small plates (tapas style) amongst friends and dig in. For someone who can never decide on just ONE thing, this is the place to sample. Their prices are a big steep but all can be forgiven once you start munching. My favorite salad is the chop-chop salad which has recently been named. It's light & airy with wonton crisps. Next up, the fries! who pays for fries at a place like this? Everyone! Their sauces are a bit more unique than ketchup and you feel good knowing your crispy, greasy sticks still resemble potatoes.

The service is... ok?I came on a Sunday afternoon in a big group (~12), and although we had a reservation AND there was only one other table in the restaurant we still were made to feel as though we were a burden to take care of. One particular waitress called us all \"honey\" and \"baby\" every time she addressed us, and I had to ask three separate times for a water refill while most of the table waited the duration of the meal along with me, with empty glasses. What's interesting is that some of the \"small plates\" are NOT that small! \u00a0And in this case, they are a good value. You could definitely make a meal out of the croque monseiur, the fish tacos (maybe paired with a side), the chicken and waffles, the huevos rancheros, and the steak bruschetta (which was probably THE most amazing thing on the table). Other dishes like the sliders, standard waffles, or crepes do merit more accompaniment. Egg dishes seemed to be hit or miss, as we saw eggs arrive in all different stages of \"done-ness.\" One friend had the salmon benedict, and was disappointed at both the low salmon content and the fact that her eggs were more \"hard boiled\" than poached.Overall I think this spot is worth visiting, but you might do well to try it in a smaller group.

Overall, it was a pretty mixed experience of highs and lows.FOOD:Let's start w/ the food since I know that's what everyone cares about. The quality of food was ALL over the place so maybe this will just help keep you in the right direction. My Sausage Skillet Frittata (minus the sausage plus spinach) was tasty. It was light and airy and I had no complaints but my waffles tasted pretty stale and left much to be desired. I am hoping for Small Plates it's because we asked for the sauce on the side and that typically the sauce helps soften the waffles a bit.The poached eggs over salmon hashed looked gross. I felt bad for my friend eating it. The egg was hard. There was no oozy yolk to be found. There were overcooked salmon pieces all over the place. Ick. But the lunch food all looked good and the sweet potato fries were tasty. I eyed a breakfast pizza that I wanted to dive into and the sliders were eaten up quickly. If I go back, I'll probably stick to what Small Plates does best - bar dishes and pizza. SERVICE:We got to the restaurant early and it was empty but the staff (I think manager) was obviously angry...we could hear her complain that our res. wasn't until 1:30. Geesh we were with two people who just ran 26.2 miles and 3 people who just ran 13.1 miles! Give some hungry and tired people a break especially when the restaurant is EMPTY! Otherwise, the servers were sweet, although a bit slow.Overall -- If you are in Detroit, I encourage you to try Small Plates. I think it was an off day with a big party.

It is tasty food but can quickly snowball into a huge tab for you. The reason is it is all appetizer sort of items and it will lull you into getting more than perhaps you realized. Plates can range from four dollars all the way up to seventeen, it adds up.Small Plates is a cute little cafe on Broadway right around the corner from just about everything, including my old place of work. It has quite a following and with good reason, the food for the most part is really great. The premise is fun as well, little plates of happy food to share. It's romantic. You can even dine al fresco and really feel the spirit.A must get here is the Hand Cut Fries, served with homemade ketchup. I recommend you request the garlic aioli as well as it is absolutely delicious. I alternate dips myself. Not good for you but mmmmm. At four dollars a bargain for here.The seafood here just all seems to be primo. The Garlic Shrimp comes with bread for dipping and is just so tasty. The Pan Seared Scallops have a heavenly brown butter sauce and are served over linguine. The Panko Shrimp are delicate with two delicious sauces. The Crispy Calamari are tender and are served with a perfect spicy aioli. You can even get a Garlic Shrimp Pizza or Fish Tacos, happiness indeed.The other stuff seems a little more hit and miss. The Petite Tenderloin is spendy but quality with a rich sauce and crispy onions. I quite liked the Veggie Spring Rolls with three sauces, you have to love people who remember hot mustard. The Lettuce Wraps are not quite as good as PF Changs though, they need that great dipping mixed sauce to jazz them up. The Almond Chicken was also not impressive, good but not for that price.The Broadway Baguette was crisp and sinful as were the Sherry Mushrooms in their cream sauce with baguette to dip. Way too much starch and fat but worth it. A bit spendy at eight dollars apiece.The salads are quite nice and come in two sizes, great if you want to share. I like the Chop Chop but the Maurice is confusing as it has chicken instead of ham and adds tomato and olives. Any native Detroiter knows that a Maurice salad made the famous Hudson's way is shredded iceberg, ham, turkey, swiss, chopped gherkins and the creamy dressing, period. Just odd in a Detroit place where they should get it right. It's good but it is no Maurice.Bottom line, Small Plates is tasty but spendy for what you get.

I looooove this little restaurant. I had gone here once last year before a show at the Opera House, and went in here again with a friend who had a Groupon. This time we had the Forest Mushroom pizza, Sherry mushrooms (YUM), calamari, and the Maurice salad (half size). This was plenty for two of us and we even had half of the little pizza left and some salad to spare. They need to give you a little more than a small tablespoon glob of sauce for the calamari though (minor complaint) although I'll bet they'd have given more if we had asked. I just have to say to be careful, if you add more than a few items then yes, your tab will add up quickly. I'd say for 2 people with normal appetites, 3-4 items from the menu should be good. If I am remembering correctly, items on the menu ranged from $6-12 each.You order your choices (usually a group effort because you'll hopefully be sharing) and the server brings out the items one at a time, with the next one maybe overlapping a little. They allow you time to nibble on and enjoy and share the one item before they bring out more. IDK what they do in larger groups, as I have only ever been in there with one other person at a time. I wouldn't recommend this place to a group larger than 4 or 6 though; it's small and can get cramped and I don't recall seeing a table that can accommodate large groups unless perhaps you rented that whole place out.Anyway, in both times I have been there, I have not had anything bad, left full both times, and had excellent service. It's not a place I'd choose to go every day of course, but it's a little different of a dining experience which I do enjoy from time to time.I am one of those appetizer people and love 'pick-food' and finger food where I can take a couple of bites of something and move on to something else. This place is right up my alley; it may not be for everyone. I am not certain though, I thought I did see (at least on the lunch menu) some regular-sized lunch plates. Don't quote me on it and I am too fricking lazy to go look it up on their website because personally I love the small plates.Great place to go before a theatre show too, and I do believe they accept reservations.", "Date": "2010-07-26", "Author_Location": "Livonia, MI"}, {"Author": "Misty J.", "ReviewID": "vndM7Hacl569IUjQ_2aj3Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The atmosphere is relaxed and the high backed booths feel classy.

As you walk in, the decor is definitely modern, the lighting the right amount of light. It can be a date setting, a casual talk setting, a family setting, whatever you make it out to be. Although there wasn't a large enough table to sit our 10 people, we sat along the black booths on the wall. Drinks: - The drinks were good. I was saddened that they did not have their sangria that night, but I chose better. - - Cucumber Gin Fizz- I was a little hesitant about the \"cucumber\" word in my gin, but as I am not a huge fan of gin or cucumber, the mixture of the two was surprisingly refreshing. Definitely an all time fave. - Club Tropicana- Pretty good, if you like sweet drinks. The coconut rum was pretty strong in the flavor though. - Pisco Sour- This was another one of my favorites. Usually the sour drinks aren't that great, but for some reason, this one was superb. - Pimm's Cup- It was alright, it was just cool there was fruit. - Cactus Blossom- My friend got this.. and it was way too thick. They didn't stir the honey up? So all the honey sank to the bottom. I mean, just the description of honey in your drink... ewww. Food: Being a bunch of girls who 1.) like to eat and 2.) like tapas, we had fun at this restaurant. As the prices are all reasonable, this restaurant was a great place to try most of the plates. - BBQ ribs- my friend and I split this and it was DELICIOUS. It was MEATY (I was expecting just bone) and the sauce was so good. It was smoked just right, so it was slightly crispy. Not too messy to, as we were both dressed up. We were definitely eating it with our hands though. - Crab cakes- this was pretty good. I'm not sure how to rate crab cakes. - Olive and Cheese Plate- I didn't try the olives (I hate olives), but my friends said it was good - Broadway Baguette: The Boursin cheese that came with this plate was SO good. I don't even like cheese, and I thought it was great - Crispy Calamari- Probably the most tender calamari that I've ever had!! It was amazing. The spicy aioli sauce was really good as well. Not too spicy, but the flavor was great. - Roasted Veggie Pizza: Eh, it was a thin pizza... not too impressive, but the veggies were all there. We were so full afterwards.. definitely worth the trip. I would go back in an instant though! I wished I could have tried more of the drinks... and possibly the dessert.

I had never been there and didn't really know what to expect. We had a few questions for our server and she was very helpful in explaining portion sizes and that most people order 1.5-2 plates. \u00a0A friend and I split 3 plates. The fish tacos were amazing, and I am not even a huge fan of most fish. The fish was cooked and seasoned perfectly and was so light and flaky. The salsa was delicious and the lime sour cream was a great addition. \u00a0We also got the pretzel sliders (minus onion).. They were good, I think the onions would have made it better but my friend doesnt like them. The meat didnt really seem seasoned, but it wasnt bad, just pretty good. \u00a0We also got the mac & cheese. \u00a0This was also pretty good, the pepperjack cheese in it adds a little spice which helped. I also tried their fries which were just standard fries but the chipotle aioli dipping sauce was really good. \u00a0Overall, I really enjoyed this place and will definitely go back for a second try. \u00a0Again, I was surprised that I enjoyed the fish tacos so much considering I rarely eat any kind of fish.", "Date": "2012-12-29", "Author_Location": "Sterling Heights, MI"}, {"Author": "Barry S.", "ReviewID": "apB-hIzjbdJZkejDDhXzlg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tapas! \u00a0Very impressed, Great Service, and even better food! \u00a0We went here yesterday for a business meeting, sat on the patio, and had some fun. \u00a0Crab cakes, Fries, Shrimp, Filet, Salad, and a few Arnold Palmers. \u00a0They can hang with the best.", "Date": "2010-05-26", "Author_Location": "New Hudson, MI"}, {"Author": "Brian M.", "ReviewID": "Ujx5dWOt--v-Qi68JOur5A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "grabbed a quick pizza here before heading to the jazz cafe at music hall. fast, friendly service. good pizza.", "Date": "2010-05-13", "Author_Location": "Detroit, MI"}, {"Author": "Marty W.", "ReviewID": "bBwRNoBBBu4jvsYUIYfuCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love Small Plates!
