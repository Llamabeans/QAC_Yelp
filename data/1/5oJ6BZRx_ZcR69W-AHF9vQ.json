Let's begin at the beginning:Hubby & I got parking right in front of the restaurant hidden between a AAA and Sherwin Williams Paint store. I was the slightest bit hesitant when I saw how busy it wasn't at 7 PM on a Friday night. No matter though - we were on a mission to find the next great mongolian BBQ place. When we walked in, we were ushered to go get food right away while they got our table ready. No time to waste! The food selection was great. Everything was very clean and well-kept and ingredients were fresh. The employees were spot on with ensuring things stayed clean/organized and ingredients remain filled. The sauce selection was great and they posted suggested recipe mixes, which was uber-helpful. My one criticism would be that the layout of the ingredient bar made it a little challenging for a shorty like me (with short arms) to reach ingredients in the back without dropping things into other bins as they made their way to my bowl (sorry!)It's all you can eat. but I only managed to make 2 trips to the chefs before I had to tap out because I was so excited for SOFT SERRRRRVE! Soft serve was a great end to the meal. Simple, rich vanilla goodness was perfect.All in all, it was good quality food at a GREAT value and solid customer service.", "Date": "2014-07-17", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Khanh T.", "ReviewID": "NEZCr0zLIPNYWNF57KsJJQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Cool cool cool!

The food was pretty decent for a lunch time meal. What irks me is that there's just a mess of food everywhere and sauces dripping in the area where I'm getting my food. Granted it's partly the customers fault to because at times people are trying to put so much food in their bowls that it just overflows. Two words of \u00a0advice would be to cut the noodles they have available. It's so long that it makes it so difficult for people to put in their bowls. The other is to please have someone wipe down the area where people get their food. This would make it that much better.I just saw someone's review saying it was very clean and I hope it is better now. My experience was several months ago so I can only speak from the experience.

I personally like that they use egg noodles instead of spaghetti like you'll find at other places. They also have shrimp, but it's the really small, tiny, itty-bitty baby kind. Don't be afraid to dig beneath the ice water they keep it in to grab some up!The staff was friendly and the chef was really cheerful when interacting with you and cooking our food. The food comes out really fast, which is nice because you don't have to wait long, but as a result the food came out a LITTLE undercooked IMO.Would recommend this place =). Careful of the chili though, it's actually pretty spicy, so play it safe for the first round.Oh yeah, and the atmosphere is really casual.

If you get the buffet, it's all you can eat noodles, and who doesn't love that? I do for sure! It's kind of like all you can eat hibachi found in some buffets, you choose the toppings you want, the sauces, and they prepare it for you.The way they cook it is very interesting. They put it on this round, flat grill and use a large metal stick to push the food all around the grill 360 degrees, by the time they finish, your food is finished. The noodles were good, I don't remember which one I got exactly but I remember telling them to make it spicy with garlic flavor. Oh I forgot to mention that you can choose the sauces that go into your noodles, I think they usually don't help you add the sauces but that day they assisted my party because we were so large.

The idea of AYCE Mongolian for 11 bucks? why the heck not right?The line can get pretty long here because of the confusing sauce mixing that we all experience at the end of the line. There is a black board of the various sauces and some sort of measurement of how much to put. It confused the hell out of a lot of people. This part was what made me give them 2 stars.Sauces? more like oil. And as if that wasn't enough.. they add even MORE oil when cooking it. After being cooked and served into a bowl... my food was drenched in hot oil! My food was swimming in a pool of oil and who could enjoy that? My noodles were dripping oil every time i picked some up to eat and eventually I gave up. Couldn't even eat half of the bowl.The idea of $11 AYCE Mongolian is great! and i'm sure people would love this place, but it's not for me.

Other than garbage won ton crispy things and some \"self serve\" rice and ice cream, there are NO sides/appetizers. I went there recently and at least three different people walked by the food area and inspected it. The meat bin was EMPTY and they ignored it. I had to wait 10 minutes (in an empty restaurant) to ask them to fill it up. Then the chow mein noodles were all tiny scraps. When a few people walked in 5 minutes later, they rushed to fill them up.

Gobi is one of the newer restaurants to open at Brokaw Commons this time of the year and it really doesn't disappoint!The thing I really like about this place is that they're open nonstop. It's very hard to find an AYCE Mongolian BBQ without that lapse in the day where they close then reopen for dinner. If you're new to Mongolian BBQ, a place that opens nonstop like this is a HUGE plus especially if you want to avoid the insane lines that come around during lunch rush hour. Happens at almost every Mongolian BBQ restaurant I've been to.They let you have two bowls so you can stack your plate at the end pretty well. The usual rule of thumb is one bowl has meat and the other houses the noodles. As for the additional toppings/veggies, it's gonna be your call which bowl it goes into.For me, pork and beef is where it's at. How they sautee the mushrooms and onions though - so good.Chance are, their noodles aren't homemade - but it's damn good. It's thick, firm and chewy - very al dente. It doesn't deflate in your mouth nor does it resemble being soggy. It's not Mongolian BBQ if your noodles suck.Service is great, this is the first Mongolian BBQ where the gentlemen there actually helps you with the sauce to use with your creation at the end. It could be considered intrusive to some, but they were extremely polite in doing so.In its current state, its overall interior design is super bare and nothing to write home about. It definitely looks clean, albeit uninspiring. I can't tell if they'll try to make it nicer or add furnishings, but too much decor will make it look tacky and dusty. I like how it looks now, but it could use a nice mural or something on the wall. The place is very well ventilated.The only few issues I see with it is that the food counter is opposite to where the the kitchen is. That means whenever they need to refill the food at the counters, they'll have to run across the room and refill it in front of all the customers. This could be a slight nuisance if they need to refill while there's a huge line. Compared to other Mongolian BBQ restaurants, other restaurants have access to the food counter from their kitchen and from the rear of the counter - which makes it easier to refill and not have to run to the front.Other than that, this is a fantastic place to get some great and reasonably-priced Mongolian BBQ in the Berryessa/North Valley area.

I'm there!I saw this place on yelp and had it bookmarked for a long time before getting a chance to try it. Got to come here on a weekday for lunch a little before noon. The trick is that if you are going to eat anything in this plaza on a weekday, you better go before 12pm because the parking lot gets crazy packed from all the surrounding businesses that flock here for lunch.So how it works is that you come in, grab two bowls and fill them with whatever you please. I use one bowl for my noodles and the other bowl for meats and vegetables. For lunch; their meat selection is chicken, pork or beef but for $2 more you can come for dinner and get all those plus lamb and shrimp ($9.50 for lunch, $11.50 for dinner.) The section that you load up is kinda of short and cramped up so it might take a while depending on the people in front of you. They have a variety of oils (chili, bbq, soy sauce, curry, etc) that you can formulate up your own sauce flavors. But if you're like me stick to the board and go with what they suggest. For someone new and wants to be daring, i'd suggest doing a test batch with not so much food and playing with the flavors first instead of experimenting with a huge serving only to get stuck eating it. The cooks grill up 2 peoples food at a time so dont get surprised if you find random stuff in your food cause it flies everywhere. I know the corn and tomatoes from the guy next to me getting his food ended up in mine.

Service was very friendly & very helpful, if it's your first time, they can help you make different flavor combos & water was refilled quickly. Took one star from service because the moment our food started cooking, one of the servers quickly jumped up to offer us drinks & asked where we would like to sit. That was good, but because she literally jumped up from her seat & was so quick to help, it actually scared me & made me jump as well. But other than that, service was great. Location is smart because there's no other Mongolian BBQ in this area, BUT it is tucked away in the corner & absolutely no way to see it unless you go in the plaza. The place was clean. CLEAN which is important. But the atmosphere reminded me of a cafeteria.

I was hoping they had lamb but not a deal breaker. The veggies were alright, enough variety for a decent meal. The noodle was also not bad. If you don't want noodles, they also have white rice. To top it off, you can get vanilla ice cream for dessert. They also have the typical sauce selections. Be careful with the spicy oil one.Now though it is a buffet place and the bowl they provide seem small, I am certain I can't eat more than two bowls.

I asked for another one so that I could keep the meat and vegetables separate, and because it's to-go he told me that it will be $1 more for an extra bowel. Are you kidding me....$8 for a to-go, vs $9.50 for all you can eat, as many bowls as you want. So to get 2 bowels my cost would be $9, 50 cents less than all you can eat. I explained to the guy why I wanted a separate bowel, so that the veggies do not get over cooked. He said the cook will not over cook the veggies as he dumps the whole bowel on the grill, cooking the veggies for the same amount of time as the meat. I asked the guy if it's his place or he just works here and he said he's an employee. I told him that you should tell the owners that the one bowel policy is ridiculous. \u00a0As I said this another lady said that you only get one bowel because it won't fit in the to-go container.
