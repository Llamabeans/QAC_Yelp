This place is the heart and soul of the Columbia City neighborhood, and in my humble opinion, the best bakery in Seattle. We still love the sourdough bread, the ham and gruyere croissant, and the amazing fruit danishes. But pretty much everything is good here. You can't really go wrong. The cookies (try the Columbia City chip!), strike the perfect balance between crunchy and soft. The cardamon coffee cake is dense and delicious. The quiche (which you can get by the slice or order a whole one in advance) is out-of-this-world. And, I'm happy to report that in the two years since I first wrote my review, they have seriously upped their lunch game. You can now get a variety of pretty dang tasty sandwiches. I am partial to the BLT (with thick-cut bacon and roasted tomato), the ham with cornichon butter (on baguette), and the salami on pretzel bread. They also have a variety of natural sodas to choose from.So, to sum up: Columbia City Bakery is the best. Come on down to Columbia City and you'll find out why.", "Date": "2014-06-25", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Daren D.", "ReviewID": "kGl1A-Yo6wFxJ3pvgEkudQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Probably my first \"I thought I'd reviewed it already\" in a long time. A recent weekend dawned on me to visit here:I parked like a BAWSS down the street by Empire and moseyed on over here. Turning right at the door entry and OH... nice line you guys, sweet! While working the line, I caught glance of the neat crowd that morning, the warm homey atmosphere (despite somewhat cramped when busy), the tasty things on display and that awesome retro rotating dual-overhead fan assembly! It's like they took 2 old retro modern fans and swapped them on a typical ceiling fan unit - and at a perfect slow rotating speed.'Got me a nice latte, a morning cinnamon bun(?) and one of the simple cookies up top. Usually cinnamon bun things I've gotten around have that nice sweetness but dry/hard bun. This one was pleasantly chewy enough AND some sort nice jam filling (maybe a cross between raspberry, fig and marmalade?). Tasty(!)Can't believe I missed this place.

Basically, after having lunch nearby, my family and I stopped by to see if we fancied anything in the case. Nothing called to me and we instead decided just to get some drinks. My partner asked for a drip and the response was a bit condescending when paired with a slightly turned up nose and the words, \"Is that all?\" After that, I knew I would go back because I assumed it was just an off day. I'm glad I went back. It was a much better experience and staff members were smiling and friendly. This time, there were tons of things in the case and the chalkboard I was interested in. Unfortunately, most of the specials were sold out, which was expected on a Saturday afternoon. We ended up getting a brownie, pistachio cake, and coffee cake. The brownie was soft with a tiny bit of a shell on the top. The chocolate was rich and had a fudge-like quality in the middle. The pistachio cake was the star of the show for me! The frosting on the outside was the perfect consistency and held the pistachios well. The cake was moist and flavorful. The real kicker was the bit of lemon essence in the layers of frosting on the inside. That subtle, citrus flavor pulled it all together. The coffee cake was made with pears, cranberry, and cardamom. Those ingredients worked really well together with the mild flavor of the pears, bit of tartness from the cranberries, and kick of the cardamom. Overall, it was a good visit and again, I'm glad I went back.", "Date": "2014-03-20", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Gar L.", "ReviewID": "Dh1tgI8AkES3EPQDn2DxUA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "What a horrible experience. Just went into the bakery around 4:30 and it wasn't busy at all. I order a loaf of bread and ask for it sliced. Not the most difficult of requests, but somehow they manage to have me wait 15 minutes for it ... There were about 7 employees working at that time, and the ones that weren't actively making bread in the back were standing around talking. So there's absolutely zero justification in having a customer wait 15 minutes for bread to get sliced. What ended up happening was the cashier realized I was waiting for so long and ran back to slice it herself.This service is a joke.

These are so savory and delicious, albeit a little pricey at $5 a pop.I enjoy that they open at 7:00 a.m. even on weekends, but prepare for a wait.

Since it was lunchtime I thought it would be perfect to also pick up a treat like a scone or muffin or something. Then I noticed a fridge with pre-made sandwiches and it was all over. There were great choices to choose from but I couldn't decide between the tuna and a mortadella with red peppers. My boyfriend suggested we buy both and we sat down to enjoy them. One bite in and I was in heaven! I bragged to my boyfriend about how good the mortadella sandwich was and he said, \"Oh yeah? Try THIS!\" and handed me his tuna sandwich. WOW! You can really go wrong with tuna if you don't get it from a great spot and this tuna sandwich was easily the best I've ever had. Very fresh, very light, lots of pickles and red onion - just perfect.We swapped again and ended up eating about half of each other's sandwiches. They were large in size and very filling. Definitely made for the best (fast) lunch I've had in a long while.

As we looked into the case to see what items we wanted, the bitter old woman behind the counter seemed as if she couldn't get a hello out of her mouth or at least offer some assistance to us. We eventually picked out what we wanted and she literally tossed my lemon tart into the box without any care (smashing my whipped cream and smearing the lemon filling on the side of the box) then sent us up to the register where we were greeted by another uninviting employee who with no hello, no greeting blurted out a total and barely looked us in the eye.

Confident on my part, yes, but I knew that Columbia City could win the duel. His choice of croissant to offer as a fighter: Macrina's Bakery.We met in a dimly-lit hallway in an unnamed office park in Bellevue (neutral ground), holding our bakery boxes, warily eyeing the other. After some teeth-gnashing and smack-talking, we got down to business. \u00a0We each had brought one judge for the showdown. We needed neutral parties to taste our offerings, although I truly felt that his case was already in vain. (He had brought PLAIN croissants: mistake #1.) The judges tasted our respective goods. I removed the ham from mine and ate it with gusto. I have had Macrina's plain croissants before and enjoyed theirs as well--though not with the same enthusiasm as CCB's. We all noted that CCB's croissants were heavier, richer and firmer in texture than Macrina's and the judges were weighing their choices. But then...a pivotal moment arrived: Everybody became thirsty from eating the croissants. I deftly reached into a grocery bag I brought specifically for this purpose. I could see my friend's mouth open in slow-motion, \"Noooooooooo!\" as I handed them a refreshing beverage to cleanse their palate. I looked over at him with a look of triumph on my face: mistake #2, my friend.The judges raised their hand to vote: Macrina - 1... Columbia City Bakery - 1.Dang it, why didn't we bring THREE judges?!

Columbia City makes a baguette with a crisp, crunchy exterior encasing a deliciously soft, air-y center.

I was picturing a place where we would feel like lingering, cozy and warm...and, this place while smelling sweet of pastry and yeasty goodness, was a little bare bones in the atmosphere respect. That is ok, though..that said, the pastries looked delicious and I had a hard time deciding and went with an apple swirly looking croissant-like pastry. While the texture was perfect, that balance between flaky, crisp and chewy, the flavor lacked. I liked that it wasnt super sweet, but i think at least the added sugar and maybe a touch of cinnamon would have brought some more flavor to the dud apples inside. Funny, I am not usually an apple pastry person, so I think that I should have gone with my ultimate, pain au chocolate..but, the look of the apple pastry drew me in, and I was a little disappointed.
