The ambiance is nice. Good mood lighting. Pleasant background music. Decently nice setup. In fact, ambiance is nice enough that I would have given the place three stars but for the fact that I saw a man's dick while I was eating my calamari. Yes, while sitting at a table facing the intersection of Peachtree and 3rd, I happened to look up at one point and notice a homeless man urinating in the bushes outlining the restaurant. Certainly not Baraonda's fault, but hey, stars have to be docked anytime we're talking about a man's cock in the middle of a restaurant review. Lots of panhandlers outside, too, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's the first time the restaurant's bushes have been used as a Starbucks bathroom. As for the food, it's ridiculously blah. As usual, Atlanta cannot get Italian food right. First of all, Atlanta Italian restaurant chefs: it's called SUGAR. Please use some in your red sauces. The lack of such ingredient made for a terrible seafood linguini - tart isn't even the word to begin to describe that sauce. The calamari was rubbery and bland, which actually keeps me from complaining about the minuscule portion they serve. The Margherita Pizza looked and tasted straight out of Chuck E. Cheese. The cheese even strung like it, too, which everyone knows should never happen with a Margherita Pizza.Oh, and parking. It's free up to two hours. Only thing is, you have to park down the street and get your ticket validated. Don't enjoy the ambiance too much and end up staying in there for longer than two hours and end up paying for parking. Wait staff is nice, but long story short, this place is totally overpriced, bland, and frankly, not that good. I'm not coming back.

After my 3rd martini, I was pleased to have the thin crust to keep my head from spinning. Their pizza is baked in their custom pizza oven that cooks the dough evenly, leaving the pizza so fresh and crusty you lick your fingers between bites. The food portions were out of control!

They definitely did not skimp on the seafood - several large shrimp, a half-dozen or more mussels, and loads more of the tender, perfectly cooked calamari. The tomato-ey sauce was just right, not too intense, so the seafood really stole the show.

People have spoken highly of their pizzas; but I don't think most in this city had the pleasure of eating a really tasty pie. \u00a0As a result, it is hard to differentiate between good pizza and rubber turf.As I've told people - I am not a big fan of the 5-star system that you are forced to use on Yelp. \u00a0I find that does not allow you to differentiate the nuances of a given experience. \u00a0I've eaten at Baraonda enough to know: Everything they do, they do \"okay\" Nothing is good and occasionally, it's bad. \u00a0I leave Baraonda feeling like I just spent 90-minutes in purgatory.", "Date": "2008-11-29", "Author_Location": "Atlanta, GA"}, {"Author": "Stephanie H.", "ReviewID": "gtmoDTbhS2yGHnHPHM9KzQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My coworkers and I come here for lunch every so often and every time I have been satisfied with what I have gotten.

So that's what we did - when we arrived just be 6:00 the place was pretty much empty, by 6:30 the place had filled in nicely and our entire area was full. \u00a0Note: They do not take reservations unless your party is 6 or larger.First impression of Baraonda was it was a much larger place than it looks from the outside. There are three different areas - the main dining room, a smaller dining room and then the bar area. There is also a small patio off of the bar. \u00a0We sat in the main dining room which was dimly lit with wood tables and chairs. If you have a hard time seeing you may want to bring a pocket flash light or request to be seated elsewhere.Our server came over immediately and was attentive at first. As he had more tables seated his attention to us began to fade and he seemed more rushed with every interaction. Service wasn't terrible but it was a little slow. I started with the Casa salad which consisted of field greens, carrots, cucumbers and a vinaigrette dressing. My only complaints about the salad were 1. it only had one itsy bitsty teenie weenie cucumber and 2. there was barely any vinaigrette on it. It's not like I want a salad that is swimming in dressing but there really was like none on this salad. Oh well. For my entree I went with the penne checca pasta - penne pasta, tomato, garlic and olive oil - and I opted to add grilled chicken per our server's suggestion. The pasta was good, the tomatoes were full of flavor but I wish I had skipped the chicken. It was really dry and just seemed processed, not like fresh chicken breast hot off the grill. Next time I may try a pizza instead of pasta because they looked REALLY good. For desert I ordered the sorbet - two scoops of blood orange, one scoop of wild berry. The wild berry was great and the orange blood was good but too tart for my taste. I'm going to try the tiramisu if I ever go back...it looked amazing! Overall I enjoyed my meal at Baraonda. I highly recommend it if you are going to the Fox because it's really convenient - you only have to park once! The food was good and the service was average.

Then when she sat us down, she was not sincere at all, dropping the menus on the table and running off. Our waiter seemed like she was in a real rush, and that we were not important to her at all. Seriously, she was walking away from us while we were ordering.Now the food, to be honest first, I am not a big Italian food fan, but this place was as bland as they come. We first had the Calimari, which was average at best. Then for main course we split a Pizza and the Ravioli Special they had that day. The pizza had no taste, well cooked but lacked any substance. The Ravioli, was as bland of a ravioli as I have had, the Ravioli in a can has more taste. The crab meat was hard to taste, the only way I knew it had crab meat was by texture. But the crab taste was overpowered by the sauce they had.

So, I was a little skeptical about eating here but after a friend's rave, I decided to go for it.I came here with an old friend for dinner. The space was packed because of a show going on at the Fox but there was only a 10 minute wait. While waiting outside (it was a perfect spring evening) we actually debated going to Enoteca because there was NO ONE there. But we stuck it out and waited for our table. We were seated outside on the small patio which was surprisingly loud. So much for a quite dinner. Our server took FOREVER to come to the table and when he finally did, the first thing out of his mouth was \"Know what you want?\". No \"How are you\" \"Welcome\" \"Can I take your drink order\" or anything polite and welcoming. It was jarring and it totally threw me off. After being completely stunned by that, we ordered the Caprese to start with before we decided on entrees. It's pretty difficult to mess up tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese and this one was enjoyable. Decent mozzarella and the roma tomatoes were perfect. We decided on a pizza and went with our server's suggestion of the Specialita - mozzarella, goat cheese, arugula and cherry tomatoes. Our server suggested adding chicken but we decided to skip it. And the pizza was excellent. The pizza dough was so yummy. It reminded me slightly of naan bread, which I'm always a fan of. Overall, the food was pretty good and I enjoyed it. But the service really turned me off. About 10 minutes after being seated, everyone left for the show at the Fox, so the restaurant was empty. Plus, it was a Thursday night. But that's besides the point. The restaurant was empty! Yet the service just sucked. There was no excuse for our server being so rude and absent.

Pasta was a bit firm and undercooked, drenched in butter. Even worse, each \"side order of plain penne w/ butter\" was $10! Total rip off.

The Calamari is AMAZING! It has a VERy slight kick to it because the put red pepper flakes on it - they are very lightly breaded so its not greasy or anything. I had the pasta meal - it was great fresh pasta. My only thing that kept me from giving them a 5 was that they were SOOO busy that it was harder to get service - but our server (when she had time) was amazing - super friendly!!

It is a beautiful place with great seating outside and very close to the Fox. We were going to a show at the Fox and tried it out. The bruschetta was ok...it wasn't bad, but I've had better at many places. I orderd the seafood pasta...the menu didn't say much other than it was in the pasta section and listed clams, other seafood, and wine. I would assume then that it was a wine sauce. But it came with a spicy red sauce....too strong to be able to taste any of the seafood and misleading because the menu didn't say anything about the sauce other than it mentioned wine. My mother got a smoked salmon salad that was arful in how it was displayed on the plate, but it wasn't that great. The service wasn't great either. In my opinion, this is another restaurant trying to be fancy in presentation and in atmosphere, but the food just isn't very good. From reading other reviews, it looks like the people that ordered pizza gave it a good review and the people that ordered anything else gave it a bad review. I'd rather go to a whole in the wall with great food or just sit home and eat a box of mac and cheese then spend the money to get food here again...just wasn't worth the time or the money. I'm not hard to please and have never taken the time to write a bad review....just sayin'....", "Date": "2011-10-15", "Author_Location": "Oxford, GA"}], "RestaurantInfo": {"RestaurantID": "5lALLFsMC3OG6DR_kZrjRA", "Name": "Baraonda Italian Restaurant", "Price": "$$", "RestaurantURL": "/biz/baraonda-italian-restaurant-atlanta", "Longitude": " -84.38498140000000", "Address": "710 Peachtree St NEAtlanta, GA 30308", "Latitude": " 33.774027400000001", "ImgURL": "//s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rJPkQ4amNwHetKk2tZ8VxQ/90s.jpg"}}
