I don't know how to say it in a nice way but the place smelled like a bathroom like they used the same mop water to mop the toilets and then the dining area. I know, I still ate there though. We sat at a booth. Note the seats were ripped. I do, however, like the diner decor and think this place has major potential since it is in a popular and up and coming area of downtown SJ. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. I ordered the \"Belgian Waffle\" combo which came with a choice of bacon or sausage. I chose bacon. Got my order and was extremely disappointed because this was NOT a fresh waffle-it was a frozen waffle (like eggo). It was a large belgian waffle cut in quarters. It was cold and some of the pieces were burnt AND cold. I thought I could over look it with a little butter and syrup but It was so hard I couldn't even finish two slices. Bacon was thin and a little chewy. \u00a0My total for breakfast was about $10 for Belgian waffle, bacon, and water :(This place could be amazing.", "Date": "2014-07-14", "Author_Location": "Palo Alto, CA"}, {"Author": "Brittany L.", "ReviewID": "D7VwNao9qy9DOMduDzd56w", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How are there not 0 stars?- dirty - horrible food ~worst service in San Jose.

I wasn't expecting their food to be anything close to delicious, but I was pleasantly surprised. The bar tender/waiter/cashier/guy was so cool. He talked to us the entire time, made our drinks with an extra spike and he really was a great guy even when it was so dead on the inside.

The burger was actually really juicy, though small in portion and not enough, but it was all the elements of a simple burger that was cooked right. We got bored so we ordered some garlic fries- which weren't garlic enough but the fries were done really well. Crispy, so we choked down most of it with adding ketchup. They actually offer seven different kinds of fries, so your options are endless.

Close to clubs, bars, the Shark Tank. If you're craving some good ol' burgers, shakes and fries in the area, stop on by to Peggy Sue's. They're open til midnight and won't kick you out if you're still eating past closing. I've been here a couple times. Here's my two cents:+ Lots and lots of seating. I'm talking booths, tables, counters for your rumps to take a load off. + Beer and adult beverages. You can enjoy an affordable pint of beer at a price slightly less than the surrounding businesses. + Cute music that fits in with the time era and decoration. 50's 60's boop bop+ Friendly staff. You'll get a smile even late at night+ Clean, clean!+ Try the banana shake! Made with real bananas :)+ Burgers are legit and pretty tasty with bacon+ Don't forget the fries!!So why the 3 stars? I don't think Peggy Sue's compares to the other diners in San Jose, but I do appreciate the fact that they are staying open and keeping up with the hussle and bussle of the downtown community.

I typically wouldn't post a bad review if I felt like i just had a fluke bad experience or maybe if the cook wasn't on point or whatever the reason, but after checking the reviews (which I should have done before), I realized that this establishment has a reputation for bad reviews on the food. I have a feeling that they make their $ on the liquor so food isn't necessarily a priority, which is ok if it works for them. I ordered a chicken with avocado and received a dry chicken patty, cold bun, and 3 slivers of avocado that made me giggle. Overall it was overpriced cafeteria food.

There was not much open after 9:30 PM on Thursday but, I had been to this establishment before and when I got to North San Pedro, I saw it was open and since I had a burger craving, we walked in.The girl that was working the counter literally forced herself to respond to my hello and acted as though she was doing me a favor taking orders in between her conversations. I ordered us two double burgers with cheese and bacon along with two sides of fries and two sodas. She kept assuming I said onion rings and after the third time, she understood that I said fries. I kept my temper and patience in check but that was annoyance number one. After placing my order, I stood there and had to ask for my beverage cups for the self serve soda fountain.When the food was delivered, I had to call the server back as there was no bacon. The sever looked at the receipt as if he were puzzled. He took the food back to the kitchen and then came back and told us that there was an extra charge for the bacon of two dollars and change. At this point, I decided it was late and I wanted my food correctly. So, I got the change to give him and in fact, gave ten cents over and had never even gotten my change back. I never even got an apology from anyone there for their mistake.How tacky! It was the cashier's error and for customer service reasons, they should have complimented the bacon.As far as the food, I have had a much better food experience at Five Guys, Wendy's Sonic and Carl's Jr. The burger at Peggy Sue's was mediocre and had a frozen taste associated with blandness.The skimpy portion of fries were nothing to write home about either.The atmosphere is nice for a diner paying tribute to the past but they need to learn about customer service and how to train their employees to care about the customer. They also need to learn how to properly correct a scenario in a way that compliments the customer.The service for what was being charged was sub par and I shall not return.

That was a huge mistake. I don't normally bash anyone but the service here was HORRIBLE! The main problem they had was the ONE guy they had to pour drinks from the bar was all over the restauraunt. So we ordered our food and drinks and the guy who was working the bar decided to start taking orders as well from the other cash register. He completely ignored me and about 5 other customers who were all standing there just WAITING to get our drinks? HELLO... I was about ready to go behind the bar and pour my beer myself. Then this idiot decides while he is taking new orders from other customers coming in that he will pour there drinks as he is taking there orders, but meanwhile we are all still standing around waiting for our drinks they never gave us. After 20 mins. of this BS I decided to get BACK in line to order food. When I finally got up to this guy he asked what I want? and I told him me and all these other customers would like our drinks. He told me to hold on while he was entering some tickets into the register which took him another 5 mins. just to do that. Then to top off our entire experiance evidently the girl who took our order accidently deleted it so our food never came. I had to get back in line a third time just to get that straightened out. We spent probably an hour there for this whole ordeal? The only one positive thing I can say is they gave me another beer on the house since they royally screwed up our entier order. As far as the food goes at this place it was just sub-par. In n Out makes a WAY better burger and fries. There are a lot of better restauraunts in the area, don't waste your TIME and money at this dive. If I had to rate the service I would give it a -10, unfortunately Yelp does not let you give a negative review, but they should for places like this.

There wasn't that many people eating at the restaurant and those that were, weren't watching the game. One star lost. My patty melt and my friend's burger with jalape\u00f1o jack cheese met our expectations, but not the curly fries which were not curly, but skinny sticks. I must have received the bottom of the barrel. Another star lost. Although, my friend did say I was better off with the non-curly curly fries than the onion rings he ordered. My other friend's mocha shake was good, except that Peggy Sues forgot to make it and my friend had to go back and remind them. Maybe they were the ones watching the game.
