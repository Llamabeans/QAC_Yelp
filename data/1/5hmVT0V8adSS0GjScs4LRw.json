Parking was easy because the restaurant is attracted to a parking garage and...yes! They do validate parking. We started in the bar area, which was pretty crowded. We were hoping to grab a table but quickly found out they take reservations at those tables so we were moved to the main dining area once everyone arrived. The bartenders were awesome! With so many beers on tap, I had no clue which to try first! So she let me sample some of her favorites and I found that the Kolsch was a winner!! It was light and refreshing and a perfect compliment to our appetizers. We ordered the Brewery chicken nachos and Southwest egg rolls, both were delicious! The nachos come with an entire dish of freshly made salsa and the they load you up on the toppings: cheese, sour cream,black beans, chicken, onions, jalape\u00f1os and guacamole. The egg rolls are deep fried and stuffed with chicken, beans, red peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, corn and pepper jack cheese! Yum. For dinner I went with the Southwest Turkey burger. The turkey burger is mixed with peppers and onions which adds a really nice flavor to the meat! They then top it with lettuce tomato, avocado mayo, fried peppers, sliced avocado and pepper jack cheese. I really enjoyed it! The fries weren't my favorite...they were shoe string cut and a bit too crunchy but at least they came out hot! All in all, I'd definitely return and recommend a visit to anyone!", "Date": "2014-03-29", "Author_Location": "Charlotte, NC"}, {"Author": "Kelly M.", "ReviewID": "iS95rBSpp1um-jg02IOtsA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Came here for lunch on Memorial Day. They have an outside seating area that is covered which was a huge plus and it is located really close to 7th Street Market. I tried a flight of their beers and they were decent but nothing special. I would recommend the red ale or the double IPA. We had their nachos to start which were ok, it is a huge serving that comes with salsa to dip. I had the veggie tacos which were good, they had a crunchy shell covered with a soft tortilla which I actually enjoyed. It came with a side of rice and beans. I really liked the black beans but there was something about the rice that had a bad after taste. My husband ordered the veggie burger and fries. I tried the fries and I liked them but didn't try his burger. He said it was good but again nothing special.", "Date": "2014-05-26", "Author_Location": "Charlotte, NC"}, {"Author": "Jake B.", "ReviewID": "bWgUaVzsKBG5YqtPWLwZlQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Went last night with in-laws for mother in laws bday.We always have loved the place and it is our go to place when we have something to celebrate and even when we don't. \u00a0Walked right in, we're seated, server was pleasant. Mentioned it was for mother in laws birthday and she was nice about it.Ordered drinks and an appetizer. ..This is where things went slightly pear shaped. Server came back and told us the appetizer was delayed. No big beal, things happen. Food comes and as always, was completely wonderful. Chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers. More pear shaped, waitress was no where to be found for 20 minutes. Wife was out of beer and spicy food minus drink.....she waited. Finally I got up and had to get another server to get a refill. She started with \"I am not your server....\" but said she would take care of it. To her credit she did. Manager comes over, very nice, apologized for the appetizer and days she will cover it. Server shows up and is rather standoffish. Not rude per se but moody. Not sure if it was my stunt with the beer or the manager but either way not our fault. More waiting for desert, more drinks, something and then the server does show up with the bill no questions asked, not a thing.The rating is not for the appetizer, \u00a0like I said things happen. It was not for the lack of drinks, it was for the apathy. At least come by and check on us, tell us the app is coming, but the server seemed to say, \"the app screwed my tip so why try\". If the place was hopping I would get it, but it was early afternoon.

We started off with the spinach artichoke dip and chips, which arrived 5 minutes before our food. Before I get to the food, the appetizer was cold and came with about 10 chips. Being there were four of us we asked for some extra chips and some salsa. The chips were warm, however the salsa, stay away, unless you like Pace's from the grocery store. Really, are they kidding serving store bought salsa???On to the food. \u00a0We ordered a good variety, stuffed peppers, chicken enchiladas, burger and chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn! The enchiladas and peppers were so spicy we had to ask for more water. Only positive, the fries, great seasoning!As for the service, I wish I took her name, but our waitress could have given two sh...about being there and you could tell.

Another review, and this time from the well known Rock Bottom in downtown Charlotte. I came here with a friend who wanted some of their beer as well as their food. And sadly, I wasn't impressed.

They added ramps as well as new things to look at and admire, such as the glass between booths and some paintings. But, overall it's all the same with the looks and what not.I had two things from the menu: Fish Tacos (RB Taco) and the Southwestern Chili.Now, the good first. Southwestern Chili. It was awesome, I felt like it was very good and chunky. However, I wish the portion was just a wee bit bigger just because it was so tasty!Another plus was the service. My friend ordered a steak and it was a little overcooked, the waiter completely understood and took it back to get another steak cooked medium rare. It was fast and I believe even the manager came up to fix the problem. They offered a soup or whatever, but my friend declined (I was wondering why he didn't get me another chili!)Now the bad. Eating the Fish Tacos was like grabbing a handful of seasoned salt and then eating it. Every single bite was just a burst of not just salt, but just sodium with a little heat kicked in, but that was probably from the amount of salt and it made it seem spicier. After drinking water, it was still stuck in my mouth. Kick back the salt Rock Bottom and pull out that flavor of the fish! After all, it is a fish taco.Overall, not bad, food is average.

It's kind of a standard place to find yourself in nights out uptown...you won't expect to have your socks knocked off by anything, but you also won't have a bad time. It's spacious, too, so it's a great place to start the night off with a big group of friends. It's a decent place to bring kids as well...the menu is pretty diverse in terms of bar food, so it's good for families. My favorite part of this spot is the outdoor seating. You don't get a much better outdoor seating experience...you're right in the heart of uptown at one of the busiest intersections. It's fun to sit out there alone and just observe what happens. It's also a great venue for events. I attended a work-related party here, and the service was great.

We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice, considering it was primetime on a Saturday night.That was pretty much when the good things I have to say about the restaurant end. Our server, from beginning to end, was slow. I would post his name, but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot, plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food.Going back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. Our best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything.
