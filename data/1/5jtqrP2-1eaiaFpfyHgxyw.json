(took off 1 star because the restaurant was not adequately warmed up prior to opening for dinner service.) \u00a0Between the 3 of us we ordered 15 small plates, including desserts! Loved the codfish bites, the sausages, the fig ice cream, too. And enjoyed every single one of them, sharing bites with each other. And the sangria was delicious.

The menus are at this point kind of dirty and a few have liquid paper on them. The owners, who I like very much, need to really get clean, nice new menus. The lighting is still bright, the chairs are kind of funky and don't fit the tables so well. There's little to no music so you can hear everyone's conversation too well.Having said that, the food was still delicious. The Basque sausage is always a favorite.

This is an owner operated restaurant. The couple that owns Gaudi cook, waits tables, host, etc.... I though the service was good. Its a charming little place tucked away in North Seattle. Intimate space. Food was very good. We got some tapas, and then both ordered a paella. We knew this would be too much food, but we figured we could pack it. I got the 'Mixta' paella that had seafood, sausage, rabbit. Yum. Really good. I like the shrimp croquettes tapas I got as well. I will be back to Gaudi, but I agree with some of the other comments about the paying at the table with their little machine. Its weird. I think the couple has been running this place for a long time together, and their operations are getting a bit long in the tooth.

Gaudi serves delicious authentic Spanish tapas with incredibly warm, welcoming and personal service that makes you feel like you are having dinner at someone's home. We celebrated a birthday here with a large group of folks. Big parties are always tricky to handle, especially when you are the owner/server/bartender/, but Joan managed the task with ease and grace. It felt unobtrusive, yet we received plenty of attention.As for the food, all of the tapas were delicious. Sausages and cured meats are made by the chef/owner in house, and pack a ton of flavor. Jamon, spicy chorizo and a sausage without casings that I can't remember the name of, were all perfect starters to our meal. Add some Spanish tortilla, which is a sort of a thick potato omelette, with a bit of garlic aioli on the side. Meaty steamed mussels with just a touch of herbs, onions and white wine, served with grilled rustic herb bread were divine and perfectly tender. I could just eat those every day. For the main course we shared three different paellas, rich with meats, seafood and Mediterranean flavors.We also consumed what seemed like countless pitchers of white and red sangria. I loved the cava (white) sangria for its refreshing citrus taste and effervescence! Sangria pitchers may seem spendy at $20-22, but you get a large pitcher enough for at least 6-8 glasses.The whole experience brought is back to Barcelona and we had a wonderful celebration evening filled with fantastic food, laughter, conversations and stories.

Not everyone falls in love with or can handle too much of the brine, vinegar or oily techniques some of the less mainstream delights incorporate.

Instead of meaning new or innovative, it derives from the Latin word \"radix,\" which means \"root.\" So innovative food comes from and returns to radical food. And in the case of a town filled with innovative Spanish tapas that push palate-limits with delightfully intoxicating fusions, a periodic return to radicality serves as a lovely palate cleanser.Those who know me know my only travel dream is a trip to Spain. Gaudi is a little placeholder for that, as the Spanish food here is presented not as an Americanized, theme-parked or boundary-pushing version of Spanish cuisine, but instead as the sort of tapas and paella and wine that you might eat or drink were you to be lucky enough to sit in a tapas bar in some plaza in some small town, or even in someone's own kitchen. In short, how you would eat as if you lived there.And what simple beauty! The salt cod, mixed with cornmeal and fried into meringue-like crisps, delicate and fluffy inside....The papas bravas with a subtly gentle aioli, and skins so perfect to the bite concealing lightness inside like no potato I've ever tasted. A special salad of quinoa wisped with lemon and balsamic vinegar and laced with silky strands of red pepper. A paella mixta with meats (including house-made chorizo) and seafood, and a rice so softly and uniquely addictive that I may never attempt my own paella, as shortfall is guaranteed. Accompany that with a bottle of some forgotten and rare Spanish red, and follow it with an orange port-like liqueur and a hearty, crumbly almond cake, and I was perfectly transported to someone's small kitchen. In this case, it just happens to belong to Jo and Joan Luna and be tucked away on a quiet block of 55th in Seattle, instead of their previous restaurant in Barcelona.

Maybe I was in the mood for emotional cheese as the ones we ate were so darn good. \u00a0So were the tapas. \u00a0So was the paella. \u00a0Oh, and so was the unbelievable sangria. We met with a fairly large group and went to have dinner to celebrate my friend Rebecca's birthday. \u00a0We all know the sous-chef, Jorge, who is one of the funniest and most adorable people I know in Seattle. \u00a0He is Spanish, so it's very nice to know that you're offered Spanish/Catalonian food cooked by people who already know how to pull out the flavor for certain cuisine. The chef is from Barcelona and, that night, he was wearing a Yelp t-shirt. They both had bandannas on their heads, which gave the already quaint ambiance an extra cool note.We started with the heavenly sangria. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. I could type the word perfect for hours and still feel it's not enough to describe this delicious libation. What I loved about it is that is was balanced--not too sweet but not bitter at all--had the perfect amount of fruit, and the wine used was pretty good (I believe is was a Protos). This Sangria, when paired up with the food, made it happen: match made in heaven. \u00a0Everyone agreed on that.Jorge came to our table to make recommendations. \u00a0They had quail in chocolate sauce that night so, without a doubt, we ordered it. \u00a0He also told us about the selection of cheeses they had that night, and recommended us to get a plato mixto (with charcuterie). \u00a0Of course, the quail was both divine and sexy. *Deep sigh*.We also ordered cod, pan con tomate, tortilla and a couple of salads--one of them featuring cheese tortellinis which didn't make much sense to me, but it was fabulous. Everything was spectacular. \u00a0You would never imagine you'd be lusting after a piece of bread with smeared homemade tomato paste and olive oil...but the Dude and I were for this one. The tortilla was delicious, perfect egg-potato proportion with a delicate dipping sauce. \u00a0The Dude and I ordered the Paella de Monte (Rabbit, Chicken and Sausage) and loved it. \u00a0What I like the best was the sausage. It had a rich flavor and a very interesting texture, almost creamy. \u00a0Rabbit was tender (something hard to achieve) and the mix of its flavor with the chicken and the saffron on the rice was very good. \u00a0This was the Dude's first time trying rabbit and he really liked it. I have to say I've never been to a Spanish restaurant in the US good enough to remember (with the exception of Txori, which is more a tapas place). \u00a0They aren't easy to spot, because there aren't many. \u00a0Some say it's because ingredients are hard to find, or the taxes on items such as cured hams and cheeses are extremely high--and apparently, there are numerous problems with these and customs, too. So being able to come to Gaudi and have these amazing dishes was a wonderful experience.To finish our lovely dinner, we ordered a dessert sampler. First, the birthday girl was presented with a slice of chocolate cake filled with raspberry mousse. \u00a0It was delicious. \u00a0The other desserts were a bit odd: some of your typical Catalonian sweets that some palates weren't ready for, including mine. The Dude loved the liquorish taste of their slow-cooked pumpkin (which had a crunchy texture). The plate had a coconut paste that I really enjoyed but there was a piece of cake none of us were very excited about. \u00a0It was a bit too dry. \u00a0The only downside was the check part, especially when it comes to groups. They don't do separate checks and only accept three cards per table. \u00a0Be prepared and bring cash for a situation like this--and you'll have to bring a good amount, as Gaudi is pretty pricey. We went there on the night that snowed. \u00a0It was absolutely beautiful to go outside, bellies in bliss, and walk around in such a beautiful, silent and white night with the Sangria after taste in out mouths.", "Date": "2008-12-16", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Qianru D.", "ReviewID": "fPQLXl10a8gndxAO2R5RtA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Updated review 11-16-2013: I finally made it back here.

It's located in a residential area on a mini main road. My husband, who is not very adventurous when it comes to food that is not hamburgers or pasta, was not happy to come here at first. He stomped around, held his breath, and puffed out his cheeks. After his lime spritzer drink that was like a capirneah without the alcohol, he warmed up to the place. Once he got his tapas, he was sold. I've never seen him eat so quickly in my life!We ordered 4 tapas - the papas bravos, a meat ball with rice, dates wrapped in bacon, and the shrimp. All of the tapas were exceptional - but I barely had a bite before he polished all 4 off. They are small as others have warned...but that's the nature of tapas. We received one meatball, 4 bacon wrapped dates, 3 pieces of shrimp, and maybe about 8 potato wedges.After some deliberation, we ordered the vegetarian paella. I really wanted to try it but you need to be 2 people to order it. (Or at least pay for 2 people to order it.) While he wasn't sold on the paella, I was really happy with it. I've had better in Spain but as the only Spanish restaurant in the US that I've tried, it was pretty good. This place is a little pricey for what it is...the total came to about $86 with tax and tip.

The calamares were tough and chewy. \u00a0This is unforgivable in a spanish place.The empanadas had a flaky crust but the corn inside was dissapointing. \u00a0We got it because, other than a fake crab salad or a tomato salad, \u00a0this corn was the only \"vegetable\" on the menu. \u00a0The mussels, at $17 for a small bowl were the biggest dissapointment. \u00a0Our server raved about them, and they were the special, but they were chewy and fishy and their wine/garlic sauce, usually an easy winner, was watery and briney. \u00a0And the bread is extra $, as we found out later...Overall, the food just isn't very good. \u00a0They were out of all but two wines by the glass, Were out of the two desserts the kids were interested in, and have almost no fresh veggies on the menu at all. \u00a0You can certainly find places with food this mediocre in spain, but you'd be making a mistake with the myriad delicious places you could eat at. \u00a0Unfortunately for us Seattleites, La Taverna del Alebardero is closed, as is Bilbao. \u00a0Tango's food , like La Brasa and Andaluca has nothing to do with spain whatsoever, and el Txori has lost its way. \u00a0This means we are left with Harvest Vine, which still provides a great spanish meal, albeit a very expensive one that isn't really everyday spanish food, but certainly resounds with the flavors of el pais vasco. \u00a0Olivar is yummy, but is hard to describe as spanish.When we were finished, our credit card was entered into a remote machine that required us to tip either 15 or 20% while the server hovered. \u00a0I've never seen this before and it wasn't very comfortable. \u00a0Being charged for the bread, I wanted to tip less than 20 but more than 15, but felt a bit pressured, so I tipped 20. \u00a0Sorry, Gaudi, we wanted to like you, we really did.", "Date": "2012-09-03", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Jessica W.", "ReviewID": "FgU-VLF3wVErgb1xh845DA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A hidden gem!

The place was inexplicably empty at 6:30. My wife and I went for our anniversary, and romantically had the place to ourselves, though another couple of diners later appeared during desert. \u00a0I was dying for sangria, which my wife does not like, and the owner was very accommodating to make me a single large glass of it rather than a pitcher. \u00a0It was perfect with the summer breeze blowing in the windows. \u00a0My wife had a glass of red wine, Vega, which she liked. \u00a0We were encouraged to have both paella and tapas, but the paella is a 2-person minimum at $20 per, and the tapas specials sounded so good we wanted to try all of them (about $3 each.) \u00a0We started with delicious gazpacho, which was very thin, like a strained citrus juice. It came in a glass with spoons, which seemed a bit odd. \u00a0We are used to chunkier, but it was very good. With it we had the house salad, a chopped tomato-cilantro concoction that was also very good and of sufficient volume to be available to continue eating as a complement to the hot tapas, which were short on its heels; fried cod balls with a mayonnaise (who knew such things could be so good?), grilled shrimp skewers (yum!), a mild Spanish sausage (good flavor, especially when cut small and joined on the tongue with other things), salted roast pork (too dry), mushrooms (a bit Chinese tasting), and grilled lamb skewer (plain, a bit dry, but good). \u00a0On the side we had the tomato and oil-rubbed toast. The flavors were subtle to medium in intensity, and all complemented one another very nicely. \u00a0We finished with a yummy cake filled with juicy apricots and creme and topped by raspberry puree, and a chocolate-orange mousse cake. \u00a0Bill was $85 (without tip), discounted for cash to $78. \u00a0Husband cooks, wife waits. \u00a0They ran a restaurant in Spain for 15 years. \u00a0A great neighborhood find.
