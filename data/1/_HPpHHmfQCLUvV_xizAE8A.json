Green Bar & Kitchen is a nice addition to the area, especially since there are not many vegetarian or vegan restaurants in Fort Lauderdale. I ordered the buffalo tempeh and loved it! The buffalo sauce spicy was delicious, the texture of the tempeh was nice and firm, and the bread fresh. I will definitely order this again, but will see if they can toast the bread just for some added texture/crunch. One of my friends ordered the garlic hummus wrap and said it was amazing. Another ordered the mac & cheese, which is spiraled zucchini with a cheese sauce... Doesn't really taste cheesy (taste more like a tangy dressing, reminiscent of the tang you would get from cheddar cheese) but it's still delicious. The only thing that I was not a big fan of was the dehydrated flax crackers that came with another friend's garlic hummus. The crackers were not very crunchy and I had a slightly bitter aftertaste. I am not letting that affect my overall rating since it was not something that I ordered personally. Overall... I will definitely come back and really looking forward to trying one of their veggie burgers. Oh... I should probably talk about their staff/service... No complaints! The young lady who took my order was extremely nice and friendly, and gave me some good feedback when I asked for some suggestions on what to order.

A-The Smokehouse Burger was better than any beef burger, period. I can't wait to order it again. Who needs beef when healthy can be this delicious? Although the menu says BBQ sauce, it reminded me more of a decadent cream-based chipotle sauce. The bun was also high quality. A++The Firecracker Bowl was delicious as well. On par with the best Asian restaurants. Loaded with protein and a tasty sauce with hints of lemongrass and ginger. I think some rough cut veggies would kick this dish up a notch.

Yesterday I was in the mood for something light and nutritious so I decided to take a chance on the Green Bar & Kitchen. Located in an unassuming strip mall flanked by a Chinese take-out restaurant and an unmarked office, I was a little weary of what I was about to experience. HOWEVER, upon entering I was immediately relieved by the ambiance. The space was clean and bright and smelled of the wonderful juices that were being prepared. I went around 4pm so it wasn't busy at all. There was no wait. The staff was very friendly and helpful, suggesting I try the GBK Burger since it is one of their most popular dishes. IT WAS AMAZING. Nothing about this burger is generic, meaning, the veggie patty wasn't a prepackaged Boca or Morningstar product or just a black bean, bread crumb concoction. It was hardy and flavorful. The bun was made of quinoa and millet, which made it both healthy and light. There was just the right amount of chipotle mayo (I was worried it was going to be drenched, since in Miami everyone loves to over sauce things) to add that extra kick. Get this burger and add avocado, it is worth it! After finishing this delicious burger I went ahead and purchased some desserts to bring home. The box consisted of raw thumbprint cookies and an assortment of macaroons. THEY WERE ALL DELICIOUS.Vegetarian/vegan restaurants will always be a little more expensive than fast food or fast casual establishments due to the quality of their ingredients. You really get what you pay for.

I love bowls and was used to some great ones in Boston; one of my favorites had quinoa and brown rice with carrots, kale, pea sprouts and broccoli and a kicking sauce for under $6.The bowl here was nicely presented but the ratio of veggies to grains was too low and I felt like the price wasn't justified ($12?! Come on!). Grains are often cheaper than veggies so I felt like they loaded it with grains to keep their costs lower. I understand - margins in restaurants are very low and they have to be smart. It was a bit boring after the 100th chew and I was expecting more kale and cabbage! Yes, the coconut adds a nice taste but steam some more veggies and add them in. And I would l have liked it to have been saucier. It was pretty dry and all that chewing got old. I got the kombucha. I think I paid $7 - again that felt a bit over the top. Sure, Kombucha is labor intensive but once you've got a viable scoby and the right conditions it doesn't cost much to make at all.

Anyhow, it was good but to be honest I liked the Tempeh better. It had a lot of flavor and 'more bang for your buck'. Bill was just shy of $30 for the both of us.

We were also influenced by the \"Order the Yelp\" smoothie special.We arrived around 12:30 on a Saturday and the place was packed. It was a little stressful inside but the line moved quickly. I was torn between a few menu items, but went with the buffalo tempeh sandwich as it seems to be the most recommended item. I also order the \"Detoxing Yelpie\" smoothies and got 30% off with checkin! The sandwich lived up to its reviews and was quite good. The bread was soft and fresh, and the buffalo tempeh had just the right kick to it. This was the first time I have had tempeh in years and it was definitely much better than I remember it being...maybe buffalo sauce is key. The sandwich came with a side salad of mixed greens and a very light dressing. I wouldn't hesitate to order this again. As for the smoothie, it was well mixed and the green spinach/kale did not overpower to sweetness of the coconut and pineapple...and there were fun chia seeds on top. The service was great, the staff was quite friendly and aware of the Yelp promotions going on. They were also quick to deliver food and clear away plates.The lunch, with the smoothie and the discount approached $20..but considering the high quality fresh and healthy ingredients \u00a0this is probably fair. I know buying flax bread and tempeh in the grocery store isn't cheap either.One word of caution with Green Bar is that a good amount of their seating is outside. The patio area looked very cute, but it unfortunately it was drizzling and we couldn't risk sitting out there. The weather definitely made the inside seating a hot commodity and we were nervous we wouldn't have a place to eat..but with people coming and going it worked out perfectly with seats opening up just in time. We will have to go back on a nice day to enjoy the patio and try some other menu options...they had a bbq \"chicken\" sandwich special that looked good.", "Date": "2014-01-05", "Author_Location": "Margate, FL"}, {"Author": "Savanna M.", "ReviewID": "QxEzC-UsaXb_MWsNBNjf8g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I'm not a vegan, and plan on meat being a major part of my diet. \u00a0I'm also not a frequenter of vegan spots, so my review of the food doesn't have much comparison to any other vegan spots. \u00a0That being said, after a Saturday morning at the gym, the bf and I decided to check out Green Bar and Kitchen as a healthy option.

This is partially because of the whimsical ambiance and partially because the portions and plates are so tiny that I feel like poor Alice during one of her mushroom-induced growth spurts. The white and wooden decor is modern yet natural and the mood was perfect as the playlist was chill, happy and indie. Three of us (normal sized girls with typical appetites) came to indulge in some wine and to sample their new night-time \"Tapas\" menu and we literally ordered one of everything on the 6 item menu. The plates ranged from $8 - $10 and most were served with a side (literally one forkful) of kale & cabbage slaw with a mustardy dressing. The curried cauliflower steak was a bit on the bland side, the coconut grain bowl was delectable without being too sweet, the raw mac n'cheese was delicious but didn't taste anything like its moniker, the ricotta lemon toast was super savory and the soup du jour was creamy and coconutty. The only dish we were really disappointed in the sweet potato truffle fries - they were limp and soggy with no dipping sauce and all we tasted was rosemary without even a hint of that rich truffle taste. The consensus overall was that everything was pretty palatable but we were all still really hungry at the end of our shared meal. We shared this feedback with our waiter which traveled faster than Twitter to the manager and the owner. We were brought two tiny desserts as consolation - a banana sorbet and a smooth, sweet chunk of \"cheesecake.\" But we were still hungry and ended up with a bill and tip that totaled into the triple digits. I'm tempted to try again at lunchtime, but I'll probably wait to come back until all the kinks are worked out as this place is still pretty new. I'm teetering between three and four stars and I'll almost certainly update it to five once I can leave here with a full tummy.

I think Green Bar is the closest we are going to get to vegan paradise while in South Florida. Only by chance did I find out about this place. One of my carnivorous yelp friends checked into Green Bar, but I think they checked in by mistake. Once \u00a0I saw the name Green Bar Kitchen on the Yelp check-in page I immediately decided to check it out the following day.I had to do some work on an annoying friends computer, who's place was in the vicinity of Green bar. So as soon as I left my friends place, I headed on over to Green Bar for lunch . This place is kind of hidden, it is deep within a plaza off SE 17 st. Once you see the \u00a0Waxy O'Connors Irish pub and eatery you make an immediate right into the plaza.As \u00a0I walked into Green Bar, my \u00a0pupils opened wide like a jaguar on the prowl. I could not believe what I was seeing, this could not possibly be what I think it is. Incredibly this place has a juice/smoothie bar bit.ly/VTsE1r, vegan restaurant, vegan bakery (gluten free) bit.ly/VTqb7k bit.ly/VTtMCl, and raw food entree's all in one establishment. They have cold pressed juices, cold organic beers/ wines and more. I had to rub my eyes, could this be true? They sold organic condiment sauces and other tasty edible items.They have a sample section for \u00a0sauces and drinks bit.ly/VTpI51. There is also a station for free mint water along \u00a0with free almond, soy and coconut milk to add to your organic coffee bit.ly/VTqvTC.I love the interior of this place, it is chic yet has an organic flavor. There are many attractive plants placed on the tables and walls enhancing the aesthetics of the eating experience bit.ly/VTmI8M bit.ly/VTmL4r bit.ly/VTmM8r. Each table also has a sea salt shaker and whole black pepper grinder. They also have a fenced in outdoor umbrella covered dining area bit.ly/Y5aMm9 . The Feng Shui in this place is awesome. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Recollecting myself I \u00a0then focused on what I was going to order. I decided on the Live Lasagne $12.00 bit.ly/VTlbiY and a Jamaican style ginger beer $2.50. \u00a0I also bought two vegan rice crispy squares (one of them was topped with mini chocolate kisses) to go for $2.00 a piece \u00a0bit.ly/VTlCd9. After ordering I asked the dude at the cash register how long they had been open, and he said about 1 week. I was surprised they have only been open for a week, they seem so well organized, like that had been open for a significant longer time than a week.The sun dried tomato marinara sauce and the macadamia ricotta melted in my mouth, they went perfect with the medium textured zucchini. The pesto just topped off what was already divine to the tongue. Both of the \u00a0rice crispy squares were sweet and delicious, the texture was pleasing to the palate, they were neither to soft or hard. The people here are super friendly, my hippy meter did not go off either. While I was eating, I was asked how my food was a couple of times by the workers.

But I came across this place on yelp because I was looking for gluten-free restaurants for myself as I have gluten \u00a0sensitivity. I was very excited when I read the reviews on yelp and saw the photos of the lovely desert counter. Last night (Saturday) I took my husband and cousin to GKB to try some vegan gluten free deserts with no intention of having dinner! But when we arrived they were so welcoming that we decided to sit down and look at the menu. We ended up sitting outside at the back of the restaurant which I didn't even know they had! It's a lovely space with about 5 tables I think. The menu is simple with only a few items but they all sound delicious. Out waiter was very nice and told us about the special of the night and soup of the day. We all ordered the soup which was to die for! A creamy pur\u00e9e with coconut milk perfectly seasoned. I wish I knew what was in it exactly, I tasted carrots and I'm assuming some lentils perhaps. I ordered the pizza (special) which came with a side salad, my husband ordered the GKB salad and added avocados and my cousin ordered the Buffalo tempeh which also comes with a side salad. We all loved everything! Then I went crazy ordering desert! We ordered the strawberry cheesecake and chocolate tart and I also ordered 3 cupcakes to go! I managed to take pictures of everything except the deserts, no time for that! Lol I don't know which was better, the cheesecake or the tart. The cheesecake is refreshing and light while the tart is rich and dense and delicious! I also had a cup of hot tea with coconut cream which was a perfect ending to my meal. The bill came to $91 I believe before tip, then adding 20% which was very well deserved by the way, makes this place a bit pricey. I wish it was more affordable because I would go there all the time! That is the only reason I can't give it 5 stars. I can understand that they use high quality ingredients but still a bit pricey. Also the added avocado for $2.00 only gave us 4 very thin slices. I think perhaps the salad should already include avocados. The cupcakes where a bit dry but I was happy to be able to have any at all!
