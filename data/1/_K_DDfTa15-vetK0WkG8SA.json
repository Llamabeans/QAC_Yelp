I was seated almost right away even though I was about 10 minutes late. Not only was the restaurant packed, but the bar and waiting area were filled as well and barely found a seat to wait until our table was called. The wait staff was so-so. Took a long time to order but once I did, everything arrived as expected. \u00a0The poor patrons seated next to our section waited at least 20-25 minutes before they got water or menus. \u00a0It made me feel uncomfortable because I couldn't really enjoy my meal sitting so close to those poor souls and I felt like waving down the wait staff for them. \u00a0I'm not sure what was up except for maybe disorganization of the wait staff. At least they were offered a free app for their trouble.Bottomless pasta \u00a0(choice of ravioli, pesto penne, spaghetti) after a long day of traveling was great but I should have passed on the Caesar salad starter. My daughter's antipasto appetizer was a lot better and wish I hard ordered that instead. Enjoyed the ambiance somewhat but it is quite loud and a bit claustrophobic but I was warned by other Yelp reviews. I'm really glad they asked if I needed to get to a show before ordering, so I will say my order arrived just in time to enjoy it before rushing out the door. If I come again, I will do it on a non-weekend night and give myself more time to enjoy the experience.", "Date": "2014-07-10", "Author_Location": "Chandler, AZ"}, {"Author": "Nelly N.", "ReviewID": "4mf5njEJISsFDY4Du6P3gw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nothing tasted bad, but nothing tasted any better than dishes I can make at home.

It is so hard to find a good place to heat in the theater district, so my standards are definitely lower. Becco has an option for $22.95 where you get either a Caesar salad or a plate of grilled vegetables and then an unlimited amount of three different types of pasta. The pastas were okay--one potato gnocchi, one linguine with tomato sauce and basil and one with bacon. I do not like cheese and asked one of the waiter's if the bacon pasta had cheese and he rudely said \"All pasta has cheese.\" That is just not true--in fact, one of the pastas they were serving did not have cheese!The restaurant is shockingly huge-they have indoor and outdoor seating, as well as upstairs and downstairs seating.

We loved every part of this meal.Although you can order off the menu, we opted for the appetizer and trio of pastas, and are so glad we did. The Caesar Salad was excellent -- not fishy in the slightest, no extra anchovies, which is usually my beef (or fish, as it were...) with some restaurants' versions of Caesar Salad. And I love that I got experience three kinds of pasta -- a basic tomato and basil, which was fresh and delicious; a ravioli with a butter and marjoram sauce that was light but flavorful, and a bolognese made with veal that was truly excellent.We had food issues at our table -- one person didn't want the veal so got a vegetarian option; I'm allergic to seafood and they were very cognizant of that. I read in a review below that someone asked how pasta can be fresh if it's sitting around in pots -- you basically sit at your table and the servers come around with the pasta -- and the answer is, \"I don't know but they do it.\" I was pretty full so didn't get dessert, but tried my friend's chocolate mousse cake, which was to die for. Someone else got the cheesecake and really enjoyed it as well. Above all, the service was so great. It's crazy downstairs when they're first checking you in because of all the pre-theater people, but once you're at your table, the servers are knowledgeable and fun -- and we were not rushed in the slightest.

By the time we left, there was a full on theater crowd and it was quite loud. **TL;DR version**This is a great \"fancy\" restaurant to go to when you have a group of widely ranging tastes and eaters. Some people who want simple, traditional flavors (aka non-adventurous eaters like my Mom) and others who are willing to play with less familiar flavors and textures (like me!)**Extended version**The bread plate was interesting. White bean paste and olives were both deliciously savory ways to whet the appetite. The crostini sticks had good bite, but the actual bread (two kinds) was a bit hard for my taste. (The better to spread with white bean paste, said my Mom). Ceasar salad was pretty damn good. Leaves were nicely coated with dressing (not drowned or dry) and fresh, crunchy croutons. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that they have a simplified wine list. A page full of $25 bottles. Reds, whites, roses and sparkling included. We picked a prosecco. It was crisp and fruity, without being terribly sweet. Mom had the lemon chicken breast. Succulent and fragrant. I had the try it all pasta special. It did not disappoint. Penne with short rib ragu (NOMLICIOUS), spaghetti with red sauce and the standout winner (which I wasn't expecting) was the vegetable canneloni with bechamel sauce. Decadent. Rich. And perfectly seasoned. Not mushy vegetables. Pasta with bite. So. Freaking. Good. Service was nice, too. The wait staff could've been a tiny bit more attentive, but honestly, they kept out of the way so Mom and I could eat, drink and be merry.

It is a small, cramped and busy little restaurant. A little too cramped. They reeeeeallllly squeeze you in there. The service was quick, kind and attentive. Once seated you are given a white bean dip and some mixed marinated olives to snack on. They also place a wonderfully rustic wooden box filled with very thin and crispy bread sticks (grissini), focaccia with a few olives inside and a hearty traditional Italian type bread. The breadsticks are my favorite. They are light, crispy and salty little sticks of satisfaction. If they sold them, I'd buy them. The touristy or very hungry thing to do is get the all you can eat pasta trio which includes either a Cesar salad or an antipasti misto. As a vegetarian my choices here are limited. You either get the trio of pasta, spaghetti with pomodoro sauce or a sampling of all the vegetarian sides. I opted for the pasta trio and antipasti misto. Today's pasta selection included a ravioli with oregano sauce which was very light and tasty, although it was not served very hot. Spaghetti pomodoro which was great with fresh basil and grated cheese on top. The other pasta was a penne bolognese. Since I am a vegetarian they brought out a special pasta which was penne with broccoli. It was very good. While I enjoyed the pasta, I feel like the best part of my meal was the antipasti misto and the mozzarella en carrozza my mom and I shared. First, the mozzarella is wonderfully fresh and gooey. The bread was light and airy, more of a delicate pastry than a bread. It was served with a bit of sundried tomato pesto and traditional basil pesto. It is the best basil pesto I have ever, ever tried. So fresh and well seasoned!The real star was the antipasti misto. Typically is comes with a bit of seafood, but since I am a vegetarian I was offered the most wonderfully creamy ricotta drizzled with honey and flecked with fresh cracked black pepper. It was heavenly. This came with fresh peas simply dressed in some olive oil. The plate had offerings of a variety of tasty morsels. A small chunk of pickled carrot, eggplant and zucchini in a tomato sauce (caponata?), string beans with a spicy horseradish sauce, marinated mushrooms, ball of mozzarella, slice of the most delicious sundried tomato, a slice of grilled zucchini and a salad of beans. \u00a0I would come back for the antipasti misto alone.Definitely give Becco a try if you haven't. If you're not a vegetarian, I'd suggest staying away from the trio of pasta and ordering something else. You can always add a tasting of the three pastas to any entree for $9!", "Date": "2014-05-17", "Author_Location": "Mt Holly, NJ"}, {"Author": "Juliet P.", "ReviewID": "NbOXRplBdWCgOjeMmX6kPA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am definitely a fan of this place.First time in New York City and I have to try the restaurants in Hell's Kitchen. My BF and I and our friend were on a hunt to find a decent good restaurant. Well actually I was the one on a mission and they just went along with it since I am a yelp addict and a Foodie. Thanks to trusty yelp, I was able to locate this Italian Restaurant.So we walked in, nice ambiance, and a bit crowded. Honestly I thought we were going to wait a while for a table. The wait was actually not bad. We probably waited 20 - 30 minutes. The host was super friendly, and greeted us right away. There is a bar area were you can grab a drink or 2 while you wait for a table. Now here comes the fun. Once seated, the bread basket with spread and olives was served, the menus was handed to us, water glasses were filled. The waiter starts letting us know of the specials. Being indecisive, \u00a0I needed another minute but my boyfriend was quick to order the \"Three Daily Pasta Special.\" Finally, \u00a0I was set on the lemon chicken and we ordered calamari to start. Everything was fast paced and waiters were super friendly.I hope you're not on a diet because this place will just break you. Literally speaking. \u00a0After dinner, we were stuffed. Let's talk food! \u00a0The 3 pasta special was amazing. You get unlimited amount of 3 different types of pastas which changes everyday.

I would get a taste here and there from my BF and everything was delicious. \u00a0The spaghetti, ravioli, \u00a0and the 3rd dish which I can't recall the name but just remembered that they were all very tasty. The lemon chicken that I ordered was absolutely devine. I loved it. Chicken was made to perfection.

Lydia Bastianich has made her dent in the world of Italian food, and over 20 years ago, opened Becco with the help of her son, Joe. Since then, it's happily served tourists, theater-goers, native New Yorkers, and Italian food lovers alike.A few friends and I met up at Becco during a weekday evening and made our way inside just a few minutes earlier than our reservation. What greeted us was a bright, clamorous dining room; two rows of tables were lined against the side of the room and each and every seat appeared to be filled. Even the bar area was completely packed, with some patrons opting to have their dinner there instead of waiting for a table. We waited for about 10 or 15 minutes until our table was ready and were led past the kitchen to the second dining room, which thankfully had a slightly less chaotic ambiance.There was pretty much no need to look at the menu, as we'd already decided beforehand on our orders. Becco's known for their unlimited tableside pasta service, an option that allows diners to choose between a salad or antipasto misto appetizer, followed by a hypothetically unlimited amount of three different pastas. I opted for the Insalata Cesare, the Caesar Salad, while my friend got the second option. The salad is pretty typical - crisp romaine lettuce, crunchy blocks of croutons, a sprinkling of grated Grana Padano (a cheese that falls in the same family as Parmigiano-Reggiano), and lightly mixed with a dressing that was not timid with its use of anchovies and garlic. For the more adventurous, the antipasto misto offers more variety, including a selection of cheeses, marinated and grilled vegetables, and seafood.The pastas are brought out in huge pots intermittently by servers who will stop by tables and ladle out a serving (or two) of the desired pasta onto plates. On the evening we went, we able to try a \u00a0spaghetti pomodoro, a mushroom ravioli topped with a cream sauce, and a fusilli alla bolognese. The least favorite of the night turned out to the ravioli; the pasta was served at a lukewarm temperature and the liberal amount of cheese in the filling completely overwhelmed any mushroom flavor. Surprisingly, the simplest pasta of the night was the standout; the pasta had a good chew to each bite, and the pomodoro sauce was fresh and well-balanced, with a generous helping of oregano and basil to compliment the acidity. The servings are fairly generous, and we were stuffed by our second plates; you will not leave here hungry.The overall quality of restaurants on Restaurant Row isn't particularly worth noting, but amongst this selection, Becco clearly has its strengths. While it may not be worth a separate trip out, it's a solid option for a pre or post-theater meal, especially when there are few other options on the horizon.", "Date": "2014-03-13", "Author_Location": "Jersey City, NJ"}, {"Author": "Reggie M.", "ReviewID": "q2aLs0Ay76eVSN6k2bWZXQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The restaurant is located on a tourist lane and for many New Yorkers is considered a tourist trap.

The grilled vegetables and seafood were tasty and well presented. A waiter soon arrived with the pasta and served me. The first was rigatoni in a tomato basil sauce. The main reason I don't love Italian food is because I don't love tomato sauce. This was good though. It was not too sweet, the basil was very noticeable, and the rigatoni was cooked perfectly al dente. Fettuccine in a veal based sauced came next. Once again, the pasta was al dente. I liked it a lot. The third serving was ravioli, but I can't remember what the sauce was. Also good. Forgot to mention this was limitless pasta, you can eat as much as you'd like.

It was a great way to start the meal.The hubby and I both started with the Insalata Cesare, which was good but not mind blowing.

The pork chop was cooked very well. The pastas were tasty. Two of the three were OK - a linguine with clams and a simple pasta with a marinara sauce.

I give them high praise for wanting to hear about their shortcomings and for reaching out when I complained. The food was indeed better. Still, after our last experience we weren't eager to trust the kitchen with more than the pasta special, and a dessert of sorbets. Our conclusion: the service is still great, and the \"trio of pastas\" special remains a fine value worthy of a pre-theater meal in New York. I can't say anything about the menu beyond that. On this visit, the hostess and waiters no doubt we're told to fawn over us, delivering complimentary prosecco, biscotti, and muscato, in addition to a nice credit. Can't complain about the service. And the food? Once again, the bread basket and olives are nice and generous, and once again the best thing we had was the spaghetti. It's fresh and properly cooked, though on this visit the special spaghetti with julienne vegetables was under-seasoned. Thank goodness a server was right behind with penne in vodka sauce. The dish featured small, vapid gulf shrimp (I wouldn't expect more for this price), but a sauce that managed to rescue the spaghetti that shared the plate. Mushroom ravioli were the 3rd pasta and better than last time -- tender, rich and flavorful, though the sauces were all watery. \u00a0When piled together on one plate, everything runs into everything else. Those photos on Yelp showing three distinct little mounds of pasta on one big plate? I haven't seen that at Becco. The watery sauces all form more of a soupy mess. My solution: you can just tell the waiters to slow it down and tackle one or two pastas at a time. Bottom line: I appreciate good service and responsive management. I'm no longer in the \"never again\" camp. If you do go to Becco and aren't happy, you should let them know before you leave. ORIGINAL REVIEW IN ITS ENTIRETY:Never Again.Perhaps it was a bad night for the kitchen. Perhaps my standards have gone up. Or more likely this place has just gone downhill fast. We've been to Becco as a pre-theater restaurant 3 or 4 times in the past, but will never go back. At this point, the only good thing I can say is they do get you out in time for your show. Veal: Overcooked, dry, and chewyMeatballs: Baseball sized, dry, and flavorlessBurrata: Tiny portion disguised by a huge greasy slab of bread with chopped, bitter, under seasoned rapiniPulled pork entree: Underseasoned and cooked until it was bone dryCaesar salad: Respectable, not over-dressed, a fine way to start the mealOrecchiette with pancetta and cabbage: Watery and flavorlessMushroom ravioli in butter: OK if you trim the edges (90% pasta, 10% filling)The best thing on the menu was the spaghetti in a simple fresh tomato sauce. At least the pasta was al dente and the Parmesan on the table gave it flavor. The Sangiovese wine we selected was barely drinkable, but at least it was cheap. The same can't be said for our meal overall. $320 for 7 people and nothing memorable. If you are on a budget but want a sit down dinner experience with reservations, and you are satisfied with just pasta for dinner and aren't too discriminating, I would still say you might want to consider Becco for the $23 unlimited pasta.

The special always makes me feel like I'm getting my money's worth. It's only slightly more expensive than in Pittsburgh, which says something because the cost of food in Pittsburgh is much, much lower. Also, it's very much a touristy restaurant, but it doesn't really change the mood or vibe of the restaurant, so it doesn't really make a huge difference.Pasta is always fresh, and even if one of the dishes isn't to your liking, there's two other types of pasta dishes, so you're bound to have a pasta you like. The most memorable dish was a mushroom ravioli that was just outstanding. The mushrooms were just perfectly earthy and the cheese was just sharp enough to create a pretty unique flavor profile. That's what it's all about. Again, fresh pasta definitely has a better chew and that difference goes a long way here at becco. Even though they'll likely serve a pretty basic spaghetti, linguini, or cavatappi, it's always somehow better than any pasta dish that I've ever made. Beyond the pasta special, the choices are definitely authentic and delicious. The polenta with crispy speck is unreal and the calamari is just your standard crispy, fried, and delicious. I actually don't know how authentic that really is, but regardless, the ingredients are high quality and you can tell.Service is great here, and the waiters are very knowledgeable and attentive.

We liked it so much we actually went back a second night, the last night of our trip, November, 29, 2013. The first time we were upstairs, the second time downstairs. The main level is very loud, although we were there during prime time and seems a bit more contemporary. The upstairs is darker, and a bit more quiet although we were there for a very early dinner. The second floor has a private unisex single bathroom which is rundown and has wires for the register tacked to the wall. Not great but at least the bathroom seemed well stocked and clean.Without a doubt, their best value on the menu is the Sinfonia di Paste, $23 for dinner. It comes with either Insalata Cesare or Antipasto Misto. I had this special both times and the Cesare salad instead of the Antipasto. The pasta is an all-you-can eat Chef's selection of three pastas served by passing waiters.One of the pasta selections on the second visit was the Linguini with Clams in the shell. Being a New Englander I have high standards for this dish and it was fantastic. They gave me loads of pasta and only 2 clams. On the next trip around I asked for more clams and they gave me 6 of them. They were fantastic. The first night my daughter loved her bowl of pasta which was reasonable for $12.00. Night #1 was gemelli and night #2 it was linguine. Both nights they were willing to stain the sauce so she didn't have \"chunks\" in it. She ate the entire bowl both nights.

My goodness, do they make a mean trio of special pasta. To start, I have to say that the staff is always friendly and willing to chat if you are, so if you're sitting at the bar on a snowy winter night you've got a friend in the bartender. We have a system when coming here. We come in to check our coats, sit at the bar and order our first bottle of $25 wine, usually prosecco. We already know that we will be having the pasta special no matter the choices so we sit back, care free, and enjoy that bottle of bubbly to the end. The second bottle, usually a medium bodied red begins our journey into the first course: bread, bean dip and olives. There are three types of bread served. The small crisp breadsticks, a rustic crusty bread and a focaccia. All three are delicious but don't fill up (and when you finish, be sure to ask for more when your pasta service begins). Next you can get either antipasta or a heavenly Caesar salad. I've always opted for the salad, with home made croutons and dressing. Once this has been cleared, tuck in and prepare. Three very kind and generous men bring full serving dishes of fresh, hand made pasta right to your table or counter. The first serving is a mix of all three. Try them all, even if you believe you won't like them. There is usually a vegetarian option with simple tomatoes and basil. The next pasta usually is fish or cream based. The third is well likely be the most delectable ravioli you will ever eat. The last two times, I only got refills of them. The most recent time, they had an oxtail ravioli. The gods must have been smiling down on us because I don't think I've ever stuffed myself with so much pasta. The time before that was a truffle pumpkin ravioli. Same happy gods, same filling scenario. I left the restaurant with tighter pants. We usually finish it all off with a cup of coffee to help us digest. The espresso is strong and delicious.

We were brought into a back room where it was like the fresh air gods descended upon us! We sat, were brought menus, bread, and bean dip,and waited a few minutes to order drinks and food. It took us a while because we were talking and catching up, and they asked us quite a few times before we finally answered.We each ordered a glass of wine, and we both got specials-- my cousin the striped bass, and I the short ribs. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and as a cook that's not something that comes often to me (especially in a more touristy area). We finished by sharing the \"eggless panna cotta\" (which was strange simply because I'm used to egg yolk in my custard) but was super tasty.After we paid the check, we sat a bit longer with the intention of leaving shortly... Until a manager (who's name I regret not getting!!) came over asking if we would mind moving to the bar as they were looking to use our table and surrounding tables for a large party, and she offered us a free drink. No problem!! She could have said \"get the fuck up because we need to turn over\" and I would have left, but this was nice. The bar was crowded so we sat on some small couch-benches, and they ended up giving us a whole bottle of ros\u00e9 prosecco! It probably wasn't a huge loss to them but it was a very nice gesture. Shortly after we moved to the bar as a spot opened up. We stayed probably an extra hour as we enjoyed our (free!) bottle and the manager came to thank us again and again for moving (which like I said was no problem but was clearly a huge help for them).Overall I would definitely return, even if I didn't get a free bottle, because the experience was very nice and the food was great.

The Caesar salad was fine and the pasta was good. The three served were pasta with a red sauce, mushroom ravioli, and pasta with a clam sauce. They made a special batch of the third with no clams, which was very thoughtful.

It is a small, cramped and busy little restaurant. A little too cramped. They reeeeeallllly squeeze you in there. The service was quick, kind and attentive. Once seated you are given a white bean dip and some mixed marinated olives to snack on. They also place a wonderfully rustic wooden box filled with very thin and crispy bread sticks (grissini), focaccia with a few olives inside and a hearty traditional Italian type bread. The breadsticks are my favorite. They are light, crispy and salty little sticks of satisfaction. If they sold them, I'd buy them. The touristy or very hungry thing to do is get the all you can eat pasta trio which includes either a Cesar salad or an antipasti misto. As a vegetarian my choices here are limited. You either get the trio of pasta, spaghetti with pomodoro sauce or a sampling of all the vegetarian sides. I opted for the pasta trio and antipasti misto. Today's pasta selection included a ravioli with oregano sauce which was very light and tasty, although it was not served very hot. Spaghetti pomodoro which was great with fresh basil and grated cheese on top. The other pasta was a penne bolognese. Since I am a vegetarian they brought out a special pasta which was penne with broccoli. It was very good. While I enjoyed the pasta, I feel like the best part of my meal was the antipasti misto and the mozzarella en carrozza my mom and I shared. First, the mozzarella is wonderfully fresh and gooey. The bread was light and airy, more of a delicate pastry than a bread. It was served with a bit of sundried tomato pesto and traditional basil pesto. It is the best basil pesto I have ever, ever tried. So fresh and well seasoned!The real star was the antipasti misto. Typically is comes with a bit of seafood, but since I am a vegetarian I was offered the most wonderfully creamy ricotta drizzled with honey and flecked with fresh cracked black pepper. It was heavenly. This came with fresh peas simply dressed in some olive oil. The plate had offerings of a variety of tasty morsels. A small chunk of pickled carrot, eggplant and zucchini in a tomato sauce (caponata?), string beans with a spicy horseradish sauce, marinated mushrooms, ball of mozzarella, slice of the most delicious sundried tomato, a slice of grilled zucchini and a salad of beans. \u00a0I would come back for the antipasti misto alone.Definitely give Becco a try if you haven't. If you're not a vegetarian, I'd suggest staying away from the trio of pasta and ordering something else.

My BF and I and our friend were on a hunt to find a decent good restaurant. Well actually I was the one on a mission and they just went along with it since I am a yelp addict and a Foodie. Thanks to trusty yelp, I was able to locate this Italian Restaurant.So we walked in, nice ambiance, and a bit crowded. Honestly I thought we were going to wait a while for a table. The wait was actually not bad. We probably waited 20 - 30 minutes. The host was super friendly, and greeted us right away. There is a bar area were you can grab a drink or 2 while you wait for a table. Now here comes the fun. Once seated, the bread basket with spread and olives was served, the menus was handed to us, water glasses were filled. The waiter starts letting us know of the specials. Being indecisive, \u00a0I needed another minute but my boyfriend was quick to order the \"Three Daily Pasta Special.\" Finally, \u00a0I was set on the lemon chicken and we ordered calamari to start.

I would get a taste here and there from my BF and everything was delicious. \u00a0The spaghetti, ravioli, \u00a0and the 3rd dish which I can't recall the name but just remembered that they were all very tasty.

Lydia Bastianich has made her dent in the world of Italian food, and over 20 years ago, opened Becco with the help of her son, Joe. Since then, it's happily served tourists, theater-goers, native New Yorkers, and Italian food lovers alike.A few friends and I met up at Becco during a weekday evening and made our way inside just a few minutes earlier than our reservation. What greeted us was a bright, clamorous dining room; two rows of tables were lined against the side of the room and each and every seat appeared to be filled. Even the bar area was completely packed, with some patrons opting to have their dinner there instead of waiting for a table. We waited for about 10 or 15 minutes until our table was ready and were led past the kitchen to the second dining room, which thankfully had a slightly less chaotic ambiance.There was pretty much no need to look at the menu, as we'd already decided beforehand on our orders. Becco's known for their unlimited tableside pasta service, an option that allows diners to choose between a salad or antipasto misto appetizer, followed by a hypothetically unlimited amount of three different pastas. I opted for the Insalata Cesare, the Caesar Salad, while my friend got the second option. The salad is pretty typical - crisp romaine lettuce, crunchy blocks of croutons, a sprinkling of grated Grana Padano (a cheese that falls in the same family as Parmigiano-Reggiano), and lightly mixed with a dressing that was not timid with its use of anchovies and garlic. For the more adventurous, the antipasto misto offers more variety, including a selection of cheeses, marinated and grilled vegetables, and seafood.The pastas are brought out in huge pots intermittently by servers who will stop by tables and ladle out a serving (or two) of the desired pasta onto plates. On the evening we went, we able to try a \u00a0spaghetti pomodoro, a mushroom ravioli topped with a cream sauce, and a fusilli alla bolognese. The least favorite of the night turned out to the ravioli; the pasta was served at a lukewarm temperature and the liberal amount of cheese in the filling completely overwhelmed any mushroom flavor. Surprisingly, the simplest pasta of the night was the standout; the pasta had a good chew to each bite, and the pomodoro sauce was fresh and well-balanced, with a generous helping of oregano and basil to compliment the acidity. The servings are fairly generous, and we were stuffed by our second plates; you will not leave here hungry.The overall quality of restaurants on Restaurant Row isn't particularly worth noting, but amongst this selection, Becco clearly has its strengths.

The noise was unbelievable for a place that only had a few tables with customers, the kitchen, the bar, the till, and the gossiping waiters!! Far too noisy. We did not enjoy our experience here at all and will never return!", "Date": "2014-05-27", "Author_Location": "Financial District, Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Hannah B.", "ReviewID": "glmrbZbXCa_1CZJGRWvgIw", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "No No No!!!!Before going here i was told there was alot of celebrities the 'old new yorkers' from the theater world. Italian which i love, but i knew obviously in theater district so you know could be busy.WOW chairs and tables on top of one another, rushing to make you eat, rude service. I went with my aunt as well so it wasn't like a young group. She had been recommended it but HELL NO never again. VERY EXPENSIVE and no reason to be. we got the trio pasta .... they come over with a pan of pasta ... now i don't eat meat (odd occasion but not a lot at all) and do not eat fish and the waiter put both on my plate even after me saying no! then it took me 10 minutes to get the attention of the waitress to change my plate. wouldn't mind but in all of this we are sitting on top of a family hearing there whole life story.
