Zen Box was an old favorite of ours.We got there and we were one of the first patrons naturally. We ordered several of our favorites, including Takoyaki and the Tonkatsu Ramen. While the Takoyaki was standard awesomeness, we found the Tonkatsu very different.It was...creamier, more flavorful, more umami-nom nom ness. How could this be? The dish looked exactly the same.We pulled Lina, boss lady, aside. What was going on here? Lina informed us that indeed, they had found a way to improve their broth. She explained the key to great tonkatsu broth was in the pork bones. The better, the more flavorful. What has been elusive was the Berkshire Femur bone off the pig because almost all farmers sell them to dog food manufacturers for higher margins than ramen shops. However, they finally found a farmer who was willing to consistently supply them with femur bones.As a result, their famous Tonkatsu Ramen is now even better than before.

They mention on the menu that you should think of the food as \"Japanese tapas\". I've filed that one in the \"whatever\" category (aren't sushi and yakitori already Japanese tapas?). Nouvelle silliness aside, Zen Box is a great place to go for a few small plates and a beer or two. Nice atmosphere, generally good, friendly service (they can be a little slow getting your first beer to you). Sake selection is OK (I wish they'd replace the house Sho Chiku Bai with something a little drier). Their beer selection is small but thoughtful (I don't recall seeing a super-dry, but I could be wrong). And they have shochu in case you're in the market for a savage headache. Hits (so far) include the aburi salmon (get the kamikaze sauce--you've already tasted teriyaki), the seaweed salad, veggie gyoza (the other one's fine too, but the veggie is remarkable because it's, well, veggie), daigaku imo, onigiri, ramen, ochazuke, any of the grilled dishes (although the tofu skewers are screaming to be brushed with something while they're on the grill) and the kake udon (but don't you wish they also did this one with soba? Me too.). Misses were the tofu donburi (I would have been happy with crispy tofu and sauce on rice topped with maybe a little black sesame or furikake--I REALLY didn't need or want the lettuce) and the yakisoba, which is a tad too sweet and gets sickeningly so after a few bites.

For this Tapoyaki, I could eat this errday.I would give Zen Box five stars if it weren't for the price. $12.50 for a bowl of ramen is a bit steep, especially considering the noodles -which are bomb- are from United Noodles.

Granted, they are the pricer, non-msg and organic kind (props!) but it still doesn't justify the price for me.I took my lady and paid about 40 bucks for my whole meal (including a generous tip), but that's a bit too much even for downtown.

FINALLY.Having lived in Japan and traveled there extensively, you become quite accustomed to the izakaya culture. Izakaya are traditionally similar to the pub culture in Europe--places where you can enjoy drinks with your friends around a table and share small plates of comfort food. I hope that this catches on here in the Twin Cities because I believe most of our perception of Japanese food is mediocre sushi and dudes flipping shrimp into their hat at some teppan-yaki place like Benihana. The wait staff which seems like your stereotypical mix of Japanese majors and anime otaku, but they are also friendly. As far as food, dont go expecting to order some catapillar-like sushi monstrocity... Go expecting a hot plate of yaki-soba noodles or some lightly grilled fish with a dipping sauce. My recommendation if you are not familiar with this type of menu is to view the items online so you arent overwhelmed with choices when you get there.

Zen Box makes the grade. The menu was put together very carefully, with an eye toward replicating old favorites that you would find in a real Japanese izakaya such as buta no kakuni (braised pork belly) and ochazuke (rice with tea and topping such as pickles or salmon). They also had real Japanese drinks such as Calpico (Calpis) soda, Chu-hai (flavored shochu drink), and Choya umeshu (not the fake plum wine). The music as I walked in was more traditional-sounding samisen music, but they switched to Sazan All-Stars, a popular band from the 1980s, and other music. They took great pains to get genuine Japanese decorations, mostly sake ads and containers, but the wooden restaurant tags with menu items written in Japanese were a nice touch (even though people who read Japanese would know that only some of the items were actually in the menu). I would have liked to see some more vegetable dishes such as ohitashi (boiled spinach), but that's a small quibble. Thankfully, not a cream cheese wonton in sight.We had a mix of traditional and non-traditional foods. The avocado tempura was quite rich, and had a nicely matched Russian dressing-type sauce. The other non-traditional innovation was eggplant ja-jang men noodles. Overall, the ja-jang men was fine, but the \"tofu chips\" were a dry unhelpful addition to an otherwise tasty and interesting dish. The sauce was largely miso, with a spice kick, and the fried (non-chip) tofu and eggplant inside made the noodle dish hearty. The execution of the traditional dishes was pretty impressive. The wakame salad was solid, and the grilled squid was cooked just firm, not rubbery. The soy-based sauce provided flavor to the smoky squid. The braised pork belly was a genuine standout dish. It was just half a touch overdone, but otherwise a really wonderful, tender, flavorful dish served with boiled eggs and mustard just like in Japan. Overall, our experience was lovely. The food came out quickly, and the service was very attentive.

Probably BBQ and Vietnamese or Mexican food, not Japanese, but they are and this is probably about the only place you'll find a number of izakaya/Japanese pub dishes. Even I was surprised by some of the offerings on the menu, including fermented soybean paste omelets (if you've had that paste before it's a very much a mood thing). Being it was my first visit, though, I was sticking with the basics: chicken kara age (fried chunks of dark chicken meat) and yaki tofu (skewers of breaded tofu that is grilled and served with their teriyaki sauce) both of which were quite satisfying. I just have to figure out what to try next: the takoyaki for sure(fried Japanese anything with tonkatsu sauce and Kewpie mayo is basically a sure thing) and then I should probably move away from the fried foods and branch out a bit. They have a number of vegetarian dishes highlighted and I think the tofu skewers I had were vegan; I didn't detect any meat/fish in the sauce. Dishes here range from $5 to little over $10 and portions are a good size: not so small that you'll need to order several for a meal.They do late night happy hours too (9PM Monday-Wednesday, 10PM Thursday-Saturday) so if you're looking to do some drinking that would be the time to go otherwise that is where things will get expensive. It was great to see they had not only Kirin, Sapporo, and Asahi on draft to focus on the drinking side of an izakaya experience, but even an ever-changing Japanese microbrew option, which of course inevitably comes with a price you'd pay for a hard-to-find Japanese import: $9 a pint. A minor detraction is if you're sitting towards the end of the bar the kitchen feels too open: white tiled walls, no frills kitchen sinks, waste baskets, etc are your ambiance, but thankfully (and I'm sure the cooks appreciate this too) the fluorescent lights are blocked off and only shine directly over the cooking surfaces in the back while the rest of the \u00a0kitchen is lit up with regular lighting.

Please. Seasoning. Please. Okay, so this place has wonderful service and the owner is fabulous (she walks the floor, fills water, talks with customers, etc). Our bartender was so fabulously friendly. They are an eager staff ready to please. Awesome Sake and beer selection (Summit Red Ale, Fulton, and a few Japanese beers that are rarely found in the United States). Great prices during happy hour.The food, you ask?The food, well, was hit and miss. Seriously, I don't think anything was salted. Even the edamame was barely salted...and edamame demands some sea salt (I am pretty sure the edamame were talking to me, asking for more salt...but that could have been an effect of the awesome Sake I was enjoying). I had to douce everything in either soy sauce or salt along with black pepper and their \"spicy\" seasoning provided at the table. Oh, by \"spicy\", I mean \"not spicy\"...though I need to be up front that I have been on a mission to build a tolerance to heat in order to compete in some sort of ghost pepper competition, so my level of spicy no longer fits within midwestern spicy.So here is a rundown of what we ordered and my thoughts about each:1. Edamame (served chilled): Um, chilled edamame...nothing to rave about. I prefer hot edamame. Not salted enough.2. ZenBox Soba Salad: Asked for the dressing on the side. Dressing was not on the side. Had them remake. The buckwheat noodles had absolutely no seasoning on them. I could not taste anything. Just mushy texture. The rest of the salad was edamame (shelled), lettuce and some shaved carrots. I had to use plenty of salt, pepper and spicy seasoning to make it taste better than um, unseasoned lettuce. I wish the buckwheat noodles were the thicker version. These were angel hair thin. And did I say unseasoned and mushy? 3. Age Gyoza (crispy dumplings): We got the veggie version. Surprisingly not greasy. Great crunch. Great flavor. As a girl who does not eat fried food often, these were delicious and I highly recommend!4. Rustic-Cut Beef Tataki: I have no idea what makes it \"rustic-cut\", but this was my second favorite dish. The meat is lovingly tender and delicious (served chilled). However, it is served over a pile of raw onions tossed within a mediocre sauce. Luckily my husband is not home tonight, so I inhaled all the onions, but raw onions are not a widely consumed food. So be prepared.5. Aburi Hamachi: According to the menu, \"flamed-torched yellowtail sashimi with housemade ponzu\". Best dish I had. The yellowtail melted in my mouth. The onions (yes, again, onions) were at least semi-cooked. Order this.6. Ika Maruyaki: grilled calamari. I love being able to get calamari that is not deep fried. However, this calamari had not a single sprinkle of salt on it. I can not believe they did not season the calamari. Thank you for not dunking it in butter or oil, but please salt it. So sad. After I added seasoning, it was amazing! Okay, so for two people, we ordered way too much, but this is a great place to bring people who love to share (admit it, we all have those friends who protect their plate like it is a diamond necklace worn by Marilyn Monroe), but this restaurant is a place for people to share a bunch of plates. Each plate is a healthy serving, so do not go overboard (or like we did, go overboard and get to-go boxes).I specifically asked for the plates to be spaced so that not all of them were brought out at the same time. Depending on how many plates you order, I would recommend doing the same.Just make sure to be armed with salt.cheers.", "Date": "2011-12-08", "Author_Location": "Somerville, MA"}, {"Author": "Justin G.", "ReviewID": "7ZvDRdJnFuAuemepE3Y_hQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Zenbox was awesome for lunch.
