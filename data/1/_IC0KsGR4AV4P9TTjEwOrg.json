Please don't be offended...I have ordered from you so many times there are no hard feelings, right? My affair with Djan's began last November, when I went here for my birthday dinner. The 9 us got a private room upstairs, all candlelit and perfect, for no additional cost! How wonderful! We had one waitress the entire night who was very attentive (and got a workout going up and down those stairs flawlessly with our hot plates!) I ordered eggplant and basil because it said \"EAT ME!\" while everyone else ordered family-style as to share. We got chicken pad thai, green curry, egg rolls, and something else. Basically everything was delicious. The thai iced coffee was also appropriately sized and priced, something which is very uncommon. I've been booty-calling Djan's for a late night fix ever since. Free deliveries over $15! Ok, it's pathetic I don't just bus but sometimes you just want something delivered to your doorstep so you can just continue being lazy. Everytime I call they say \"45minutes\" but they always come within 20! Now that's what I call \"underpromise and overdeliver (literally, ha.ha)\" -- it's a work ethic I like very much. I usually get the same fare every time: tom ka gai, pad thai, green curry or eggplant basil, and brown rice. This more than enough for 2 meals for me and my boyfriend combined.Their pad thai is seriously THE best in Seattle. It makes Thai Tom's mess of stomach-churning, rule-violating noodles look, well, like just what I described...disgusting. It is the perfect texture and sweetness. Mmm. I know I'm not very authentic in my Thai food but hey it tastes damn good. Their tom ka gai is always perfect (though I have to say my own recipe is pretty good also) and the little button mushrooms floating on top always gets my appetite on. Eggplant is consistently tasty, but still isn't quite as good as Sichuan Cuisine's...but that's just on a totally different level.Anyway.The green curry is delicious and definitely not curry paste stuff (I have the curry paste, I know how it tastes) and once I also got spicy basil chicken but that took my tongue off. I'd say the 5 stars is really 5 stars so I actually go for 4 [insert look of shock here] which is just enough spicy and just enough mild so I can actually taste the food without crying.

I'm not sure how they do it, but all of the different seafood is done to \u00a0perfection and not overcooked to the point of rubber I've experienced elsewhere. \u00a0I also like the level of heat that is acquired in their food. 3 stars gives you fire and flavor, the way I like it.

The food here is consistently delicious and well-prepared.I've tried quite a few entrees from their menu so it's hard to choose a favorite dish, but my top two choices include their house signature dish called Djan's Fusion Noodle. It's a combination of Phad Kee Mao and Phad Thai with the most divine blend of spicy and sweet from the respective two dishes. It's normally served with the skinny, Phad Thai noodles, but I would recommend ordering it with fat, wide noodles instead - more noodle and flavor for your buck!The Garlic Lover is also a great dish. This entree is a hearty mix of your choice of meat with perfectly stir-fried vegetables married in a delectable oyster, soy sauce gravy. If you order rice, I would suggest to dunk it in the leftover sauce of this dish. My boyfriend LOVES their curry chicken skewers from their appetizer menu and orders them about 90% of the time. Although I normally had their food delivered, when I did dine in, I thought their service was impeccable and the atmosphere simple, but welcoming.

Fortunately, for those who live in North Seattle, Djans qualifies as a good choice to occupy the first chair for Thai take-out. First of all, Djans is flexible with delivery and take-out service with free delivery for orders over $15. The delivery range is 2.5 miles, which due to the strategic location in Wallingford, covers most of North Seattle. Second, the food is consistent and at the upper range for the Thai food genre. I confess that I haven't tried the entire lineup of Djan's take-out, usually ordering the Pad Thai/Fusion Noodle/Chicken Cashew Nut/Spring Rolls, but I've never been disappointed. They also do a good job with the spices and I'm a little wimpier here: they range their spices from 1 to 5 (5 being the spiciest) and I typically pick the \"2\". Prices are reasonable with the entrees in the $9-10 range.As for the restaurant itself, I've never actually dined in here, but I've stood around and wandered long enough to pretty much get a good feel of the place. Djan's is a converted house and the dining area is one room on the side. It has a minimalist design with a simple white background that seems to work. They also have gone with the eternal-Christmas approach of decorating by winding small holiday lights along the outside of the building.The check-out area is at the foot of the stairs and you'll be standing in the front hallway while you're waiting for your carry-out. In these converted houses, I've always wondered a little bit about what they have in the upstairs rooms. Storage? Banquet rooms? Secret meeting halls? I'm not a pyromaniac, but I've been tempted to start a small fire in a garbage can to distract them so that I can run upstairs and find out.

Most restaurants violate the good name of eggplant with the gooey, lumpy dishes they put out. Djan's eggplant was flavorful and had just the right texture.

I used to live across the street from it, and wasn't terribly impressed with the food. However, they must have changed it up since I was there last. I left full, happy, and with my taste buds doing \u00a0a happy dance. Everything was delicious. Additionally, the service was fast and courteous, and the lemon in the water was well appreciated.We started with two appetizers: Fresh Rolls and Beef salad.The Fresh Rolls were served warm and were simple, with fried tofu and fresh cabbage in the middle and a lightly sweet teriyaki-type sauce drizzled over the top. They were good, but a little heavy for what I had expected.The Beef Salad was up next on the menu, and was quite perfectly spiced and cooked. The meat was cooked thoroughly, but was tender and light, and the fish sauce vinaigrette it was tossed in was very nice. It gave it a crisp citrus bite, with a little bit of kick. This dish was both refreshing and filling. If given the opportunity (luckily I wasn't), I could have eaten several plates of this.For our main courses, we had brown rice (cooked better than any brown rice I have had previously), Scallops al Dente, and Panang Curry chicken. \u00a0Both dishes were fabulous, though the scallops, having a much more delicate flavor, really needed to be eaten first. If (as my sweetie did) you start right in on the curry, it makes it difficult to distinguish the flavors of the scallop dish.The scallops were in a ginger-soy dressing, and had celery, green onion, peas, carrot, onion, slivers of ginger, and scallop. All were cooked to perfection - nothing in this dish was even a second overcooked or undercooked. I was very pleased to see that they didn't skimp on the scallops, either. Too often, when ordering scallops, I find I have overpaid horribly for the amount of seafood that was actually plated. With Djan's, I was terribly impressed. I imagined that the scallops I make at home for myself had just shaken their (metaphorical) fists at me. These were prepared better.The Panang Curry was a great thickness, and consistently creamy. The flavors were all there, though I would have liked it a little bit spicier. Our \"four star\" request equated to about two stars on the palate. However, given that the flavors were so well put together, I am somewhat glad it wasn't hotter. It really helped me to appreciate the flavors that were going on. The ingredients were all very fresh, and the chicken was nice and tender.Everything was very well put together, flavor and texture-wise. The service was spot on, as was the atmosphere. The prices were average to a touch high for the specials, such as the scallops ($15.50), but well worth the price.

I also got a Thai iced tea which was great, but those are hard to mess up anyway.2nd time, we got the calamari and the samurai pad thai. One important thing to note about the calamari is that it's nothing like MOST other calamari dishes. It is literally an individually fried calamari TEMPURA style. You can imagine my disappointment when I opened the box (we got take out) and saw 10 pieces of tempura calamari. So I should note that I absolutely hate tempura- it's just too much fat and crunchiness for me to handle and it's just never seasoned right. To make things worse, the calamari doesn't actually have much taste. If it wasn't for the duck sauce they provided on the side, this dish would be a miserable fail :( and it already was a fail for me, unfortunately.Now, the samurai pad thai, despite having tempura shrimp on it (lol), was very very tasty.

Dessert was unfortunately the reason I bumped my review down from 5 stars. While still rich and chocolatey, the mousse was obviously frozen and lacked the light airy texture I was expecting.

I had the garlic chicken - no rice just over vegetables and it was fantastic. I agree with other reviewers that their spiciness scale is tuned to pretty spicy so my 2 (on a scale of 1-5) was actually more spicy than I would have preferred but still edible.

Overall, I like the flavor of djan's food, but it's not always spicy enough.", "Date": "2012-02-22", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Lucy C.", "ReviewID": "87ynGH5K4cVcTR1G6ZvcLQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered a lunch combo from here last week (for delivery), and the pad thai was both flavorless and mushy. I mean, these aren't noodles that have been soaking in water for a few days straight, so why are they mushy?!
