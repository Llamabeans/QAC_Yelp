However, I'm going to make a few suggestions in case management reads their reviews:1) \u00a0Print off new menus every day or laminate and clean the ones you have. \u00a0Menus should look amazing. \u00a0Go to Marche and you'll see that they print off a new menu every night. \u00a0It's not enough to lower the star rating of this restaurant but it is a bad first impression.2) \u00a0Train your servers to greet and present your restaurant like it's a 5-Star experience. \u00a0I think the food is so good and so unique that they should share about their chef and about what makes Aura unique. \u00a0Give your guests the feeling that it's an \"experience.\"3) \u00a0Have your staff dress color-coordinated. \u00a0All black might work for this kind of restaurant. \u00a0It helps you spot your servers and it raises the overall value equation for what you'd expect to pay.4) \u00a0Have the chef provide a complimentary taste of an appetizer, desert, drink, or shrimp. \u00a0Something unexpected that delights your customer and makes them want to right a rave review!I hope this helps. \u00a0We will come back some time but I do hope more people try it out. \u00a0Their chef is truly very gifted.", "Date": "2014-06-27", "Author_Location": "Franklin, TN"}, {"Author": "Samuel E.", "ReviewID": "dyomI2UnWjLNPz3rwdMxTw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This place has some of the best and most interesting food and is consistently fantastic.

And I plan to go back to have what I didn't. Some fusion restaurants make me feel like the chef throws up ingredients and create a recipe from what falls in the same place, kind of like top chef. In this case, the mix of flavors is intentional. I was so excited about the menu and it didn't disappoint. The roasted salmon deserves to be on a runway, it was so pretty. The braised kale was so great, and the collards were almost as exceptional. I am not a crawfish fan but the potato skins were an intriguing taste, and the potato croustard would have been delicious without the shrimp. The mac and cheese had a medley of cheeses, so it was too mature for my 6 year old, though she ate it. My main goal was getting to the bread pudding. It was an absolute delight.

Ever. In any genre of cuisine, in any city - this wins the award for being the worst. I wish there was something redeeming, but alas, there was nothing. Start to finish - from the menu, to the service, the bar, food & environment - just absolutely awful. I'm skeptical about anyone who is raving about this place, because it's not even slightly redeemable. This is the closest I've ever gotten to a real life Kitchen Nightmare. So there's that....A dirty vodka martini that tasted like a jar of old olives. Potato skins that tasted microwavedA salad that was more dull than grocery bag saladA steak that half way through revealed some truly 'funky' tastes (clearly frozen and reheated)And wrong wine pours all night. The menu is that of a confused chef (although I would be very surprised if there is an actual chef running the kitchen). Fusion doesn't mean you just mish mash two random things together. It's not fusion by using Hawaiian fish and Indian rice. The server couldn't even tell me if the salmon was farmed or fresh caught. She also poured us the wrong wine several times. The best past was when she came back to our table long after we finished our appetizers to say she had forgotten what we wanted for our mains. *sigh*And the best part was towards the end of our meal when we learned that the people milling about with a bunch of lighting and equipment were setting up for their COMEDY SHOW. Why in the world would I pay $200 for a dinner just to be interrupted with fart jokes? Seriously, this was abysmal.

No big deal - it was still early. Maybe they were still getting into the swing of the evening.Nope. We sat there for about 25 minutes. 25 ENTIRE MINUTES elapsed, and not a single server had graced us with his/her presence.

I highly recommend the mac & cheese!I wouldn't say that anything was \"bad,\" so I'll say the next part was \"okay\": We each ordered a cocktail, before we had our main dish.

The coconut curry mushrooms with toasted flatbread was out of this world. And I sampled the not-so-typical bread pudding and it was amazing. Our server was very attentive, so overall I'd say we had a great experience.

I wish I had the budget to come here more often.For lunch, I've twice had the Chicken-Tasso Gumbo and Greek Salad. Both were filling and tasty, and I was pretty happy with the price. For drinks, I recommend the Mad Hattan. This is a great take on a traditional Manhattan, with the added bonus of Absinthe. I like a good, stiff drink from time to time - especially when I'm at a fancy place - and this was exactly what I was craving. I will warn you to be careful, as I underestimated the potency on my first visit.I had a great Groupon tucked away for dinner, so I took my date here for Valentine's Day. The experience was one of the best I've had in Nashville in some time. First, the server was very professional and perfectly attentive - not too chatty, but good-spirited and knowledgeable about the menu. He almost had me sold on the evening's Salmon special. If only I was a fan of Salmon...We started with cocktails. I had my earlier-mentioned Mad Hattan, and my date choose some white wine. We started with the Beef Chimichurri appetizer. The thin strips of steak and the chimichurri sauce could have been a delicious meal unto themselves.I picked the Seared Ahi for my meal. It was seared perfectly, with the rare center warm but not hot. The Bok Choi accompaniment was good, but a little gritty. My date selected the Filet Mignon, medium. The steak was flavorful, but a little more on the medium rare side than we expected. The ginger mash potatoes that accompanied her dish made up for it, though. I really wish they'd share the recipe...We splurged on dessert and ordered the Apple Fritter with house-made frozen mango yogurt. The fritters had the flavor and texture of classic state fair beignets with a pleasant, subtle apple undertaste. The mango frozen yogurt was a great pairing for the apples - one I would never have picked out on my own. The mango flavor was dominant, with the yogurt taste on the finish. I am withholding the fifth star for two nit-picky reasons. First, the bok choy that came with my Seared Ahi was a little gritty. At one point, I bit unexpectedly into something a little bit hard (still not sure what) what made me pause to make sure I hadn't hurt a tooth. I was fine, and I moved on. The second reason was the pacing of the courses. Our server took the initiative to promise our appetizer and entrees would be spaced well (we didn't bring this up as a concern at all, but he volunteered it), but this proved not to be the case. Our entrees came out while we were still half way through our appetizer. My fiancee and I eat fast, so there was something off about the timing despite the server's assurance. We did get an immediate apology from the server when this happened. Again, this is a little nit-picky, but when I spend over $100 on a meal for two it's something that will keep me from giving a perfect review.Despite a couple small hiccups, Aura is worth a visit.", "Date": "2013-02-25", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "Tommy S.", "ReviewID": "I0gckGXevW0HjfsS3Yws2w", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Aura was the worst dining experience I've ever had in my life. I was vacationing from Chicago to Nashville, and thought to try Aura. Worst mistake I could have done. To begin with, we went on a Saturday, and the server took 15 minutes to greet us. After greeting us, I started noticing my surroundings. The table next to us had issues with food and was talking to the manager. Then, a server dropped a dish on a table on the other side of me. I thought I was in some alternate universe. After that, another two top table was sat next to us, and ultimately walked out because they never had anybody come greet their table. Our server forgot appetizer plates, when delivering our appetizer. Everyone seemed nervous and disorganized. It was painful to watch.However, I was hoping the kitchen would redeem my experience. I was very wrong. My spouse and I ordered identical orders. Filet, medium. My steak was extremely overcooked and his came out raw. The potatoes were grainy, which made me suspect if they were from a box. At this point, I wanted to cut my losses and leave. The manager was apologetic and seemed surprised, when I explained everything that was wrong. She wasn't even aware of the table walking out next to us! She insisted on giving us free dessert, which was nice. However, our server seemed irritated, so we paid our bill and left. We took our desserts home.

I was thrilled to receive the news a couple of months ago that a promising new restaurant would revive the space. Last Friday, Aura World Fusion Cuisine opened their doors to the Nashville public but this broad was lucky enough to score an invitation to the \"soft-opening.\" Trust me when I say that I have attended many pre-openings and not been impressed to the level that I was this past week...Let's talk food first, shall we? The innovative menu pleased not only my palette but also my friend's carnivore instincts as well. From starting with invigorating Lemon Miso soup (chilled Asian dashi - white miso - fresh lemon) and Arugula/Frisee salad (root vegetable chips - spiced pumpkin seeds - and mint vinaigrette) to the Angel Hair Pasta (veganized with a delicious assortment of veggies) and concluding with the custom fruit dessert, everything was thoughtfully concocted and presented. Between two diners with four courses (he ordered the NY Strip, Beef Chimichurri, and Crawfish Potato Skins amongst other things) and two libations each, our bill came out to around $150. This would not be a hefty price to pay for a special evening out. Don't fret as you don't need to \"go all out\" to dine here. Bites are reasonably priced and I look forward to hitting Aura up for lunches and late night bites too (they serve food through midnight).Pertaining to libations, the cocktail list is sprinkled with interesting crafty cocktails and the wine list offers up a nice assortment. The standout feature is the Darcie Kent Vineyards Wines powered wine tap machine at the bar! I was tempted to do a pseudo keg stand but was able to restrain myself. The Pinot taste that I had was just okay but the Cabernet ticked my fancy. Give it a swirl at around $8 a glass.The beautiful \u00a0and moody renovated space offers up beautiful nooks, private dining area, spacious bar area with lounge, and spacious main dining area that all offer a different perspective throughout.

A friend of ours had attended a Yelp Elite event here the previous week and raved about some of the food she tried, so we decided to give it a shot.Since we were there for happy hour, let's start with the drinks: wine on tap. Odd concept to me initially, but I'm a total fan now. We tried three of the four kinds they had on tap, and I was \u00a0extremely surprised that the chardonnay was my favorite. I usually can't stand chardonnay, but the one they had on tap was phenomenal. I'm very thankful for that $5 happy hour special and the generous pour - it definitely went well with our dinner. Now, on to the food...We stuck with the small plate items, ordering some from the happy hour menu and some from the regular small plates menu. First, we tried the edamame hummus. Is it wrong that I'd like to be buried in that stuff and have to eat my way out? There were so many complex flavors for a hummus and the only issue was that we needed more bread to eat every bite of it. We also tried the crawfish potato skins, the fried pickles and the seared beef chimichurri. Each dish was just as good as the last. Although the potato skins look to be made with fingerling potatoes (which means it's smaller than your average potato), it was still enough to satisfy three of us. The fried pickles were delicious as well, and I'd have to say their recipe is one of the best that I've tried. I enjoyed the seared beef chimichurri, but probably wouldn't order it regularly.From the regular small plate menu, we ordered the pork belly flatbread, and that was the only disappointment. All other pork belly I've tried fell more into the bacon category, but theirs was reminiscent of pot roast or shredded pork. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I was expecting. The service was exceptional the night we visited. Our waitress, Cindy, made sure we were taken care of and several other staff came by and visited as well. I would have given them a full five stars if it weren't for an issue with our bill. At the restaurant, there was no problem, but when I later checked my bank balance, there were multiple authorizations from Aura. Our bill (with tip) was $89, but there were over $180 in authorizations. From what I gathered, they screwed up when running the card, but it didn't actually clear as a purchase. We called them the next day and no one answered, so we had to leave a message. Now, one week later, they still haven't called us back. At least everything worked out with our bank, but it would have been nice to have a return call from Aura with some sort of explanation.

The atmosphere and potential I KNOW Aura has is what keeps me pushing my friends to come back even though they had already given up on it. The times I've been in the past (with the exception of NYE) the service and food have been great. But this particular Sunday when we went I left feeling sad and disappointed. :(For starters the place was EMPTY. Yes, it was a holiday weekend, but still. It was Sunday around 6pm so you would think there would at least be a few people out enjoying the evening. There were us 4 in the lounge area and at most 2 tables being occupied in the dining room. There was no valet and no hostess greeting us at the door this time. Obviously those services aren't needed when you only have 10 patrons in the whole restaurant but those services were part of what made Aura inviting. There appeared to only be one waitress and one bartender working. Service was still friendly, but a little slow considering how few customers there were. We had a bottle of wine, which even on a half-price discount was still over $30. A little ridiculous. This DID NOT taste like a 60-something dollar bottle of wine. Not that ANY bottle of wine is worth that much to me considering I can get a cute little buzz off a $7 bottle of Turning Leaf. But we had a $100 gift card to burn (as a result of our terrible, but forgiven NYE experience) so we didn't really check the price of the wine before ordering so I guess that's our fault. We also each ordered a cocktail. My bf and 2 friends liked theirs and my Brazilian Berry tasted good but I seriously couldn't taste any alcohol in it. We ordered the edamame hummus and pita bread to snack on with our wine and cocktails and it was yummy but the portion size has been cut in half. The music has also changed since my last visit. It used to be chill, jazzy sounding music and this particular night it was some Kenny G sounding mess. Just weird. I'm almost positive my 2 besties will never step foot in this place again but I maaaay be able to convince some other friends to check it out. But I don't want you to let me down, Aura!

While at the event she sent me a text and said that we had to go there the next time we met for happy hour. All she had to say was \"wine on tap\" and I was convinced that it would be way sooner than later. The following Friday we arrived and were met by the friendly valet in front of the restaurant. He was very polite and friendly, and was quick to open the car door and welcome us. As we approached the door it was immediately opened for us and we were once again warmly welcomed into the entrance. So far, they are off to a great start. The interior was warm and contemporary, with red and black as the color scheme, and nice warm touches of exposed brick. In addition to happy hour, I would also recommend Aura for a romantic date considering the dining area was a little darker and moodier.... perfect with the jazz they had quietly playing throughout the restaurant. As they were seating us, we told them that we wanted to sit in the bar area since we were interested in the wine on tap and sharing a few different smaller bites on the menu. We were shown to our table and quickly introduced to our waitress. Cindy greeted us and explained the specials and wines on tap. She was very nice and went out of her way to make sure she was available to answer our questions. Once we decided, she quickly returned with our first round of wine and was very helpful in describing the wines and the dishes they would complement best. For the wines, we tried the Chardonnay, the Pinot Noir, and the Gr\u00fcner Veltliner. In my opinion, the Gr\u00fcner was the best. Slightly sweet and flexible enough to go with all of the dishes that we paired it with throughout the night. The servings were generous, and were actually served in small, individual carafes that contained two pours per order. This was great and made me feel that I was getting more wine for my money, which is always a good thing. I was initially a little skeptical about the wine on tap as far as freshness is concerned, but I was pleasantly surprised that not only was the wine fresh, it was perfectly chilled to the ideal temperature. Our small plates included beef with chimichurri, pork belly flatbread, fried pickles, potato skins with crawfish, and the edamame hummus. The beef chimichurri was my least favorite and was a little cold when it got to the table. It had pickled, or marinated zucchini strips on top and they were kind of tasty, but the overall impression was a little bland and overdone. Not horrible, just not much flavor. The pork belly flatbread was decent, but also didn't knock my socks off with flavor. I felt that the pork belly was a let down compared to other times I've tried it, where it is usually crispier and more flavorful. I also thought that the sauce on the flatbread was a little plain, but not that bad. The fried pickles were really good and had a nice pickle to breading ratio. They also came with a tasty dip that added a nice kick to them. The crawfish potato skins were also really good and were served on a creamy and spicy sauce and topped with small chunks of goat cheese. The edamame hummus was the absolute stand out and even though I love edamame, I was amazed at how incredibly delicious this dish tasted. Seriously. You have no idea. Edamame blended with honey, ginger, and sesame oil create a smooth, mildly sweet and nutty flavor that is like nothing I've had before. If you go you must try this, even if you are unsure about the combination of ingredients. Trust me, your taste buds will make sense of it all. Even though a few aspects of our meal were a little disappointing, I was really impressed with our service, the wine, and the majority of our dishes. Overall, I would say that Aura is worth a visit and the small bites during happy hour with friends are a great way to experience a variety of their offerings without being limited to a single dish. I will definitely be back to enjoy the wines on tap and the other small bites we didn't try the first time. They are also open for lunch and had some really good specials that were competitive with other nearby lunch options. I plan on getting back to try their lunch menu and see how it compares with what I've had so far and I can't wait to give their happy hour another try soon.", "Date": "2012-12-01", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "Allison B.", "ReviewID": "TxmPLjNi_FCWPECYoIg8Jw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Time for an update, because brunch has earned Aura and extra star.

The flavor was actually good, but the consistency was TERRIBLE. \u00a0Having to chew a piece of meat more than 10 times in order to break it down is simply nauseating. \u00a0We sent it back (I try to never do that) and ordered the appetizer of steak/chimichurri instead. \u00a0The flavor, once again, was good, but the meat was - once again - tough. \u00a0I should mention that the manager came to the table, was very accommodating, and didn't charge us for either of the steak dishes. \u00a0All in all, I wouldn't go back.", "Date": "2013-01-20", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "Justin C.", "ReviewID": "7GXOAFaObEhgjnZ1pObYRQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This place was good, but not great. \u00a0I used a Groupon which \u00a0made it worth it. \u00a0The service was very good. \u00a0Off-street park is always nice. \u00a0The restaurant is kind of cool. \u00a0the food was decent, but I think there are better options out there for the price.", "Date": "2013-04-02", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "Al M.", "ReviewID": "oEsn_PVmym85c8xe4xvInA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great dinner and great service.
