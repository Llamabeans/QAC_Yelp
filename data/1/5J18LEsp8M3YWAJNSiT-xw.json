I declined because I already had something in mind. The young lady taking my order ask the make/model of my first car. It took me a second to respond. .This is how they call you when your order is ready...hahaha! \u00a0Pretty cool stuff. \u00a0I guess they switch the question every week. The Five and Dime is a biscuit heaven sandwich! . Crispy juicy chicken breast, thick sliced Applewood bacon, \u00a0a fried egg, and cheese...to think that wasn't good enough they topped it with a spicy gravy. OMGOODNESS!..At first glance, \u00a0you think there's no way you will eat all of it but then at first bite you can't stop eating it until it's all gone. \u00a0The flavors compliment each other. The flaky biscuit absorbs the gravy to perfection! \u00a0The well seasoned crispy chicken breast is the backbone of the sandwich and adds the perfect texture. This biscuit wouldn't be right without the bacon. I wanted to order one to go so my hubby could try but didn't. \u00a0He need to try this fresh. I will definitely be trying this place again. \u00a0Many other interesting biscuit sandwiches on the menu. \u00a0The place has a nice open atmosphere and a outside eating patio. The staff was excellent and the price will make you wanna go someplace else BUT stay. It's worth it. \u00a0I spent $10.60 for my sandwich and drink. \u00a0The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the orange juice cup was way too small for the price. It look like a child small. \u00a0So I was forced to have a soft drink or sweet tea with my biscuit sandwich.

We ordered the following items: THE FIVE AND DIME. Frank LOVED it! He ate the whole thing and said it was delicious and filing. THE STICKY MAPLE. I had this one. Delicious. I got the maple on the side so I could dunk it at will. THE BLUES BISCUIT. Analis had this one and ate the whole thing as well. SMOKEY MOUNTAIN MAC N CHEESE. Was truly delicious. I love mac n' cheese and this was awesome. The cheese cracker toppings were a nice touch. HASHUPS. Frank loved these cheesy potatoes with all his favorite ingredients. He really enjoyed these. The owner stopped by our table and had a nice chat with us. He lived in Savannah for \u00a0some time and offered plenty of suggestions for our next time there. That was very nice of him! We really enjoyed our stop and the food was delicious. We were a party of 3 and spent about $38. The food was delicious and for what you get, I think it is reasonably priced.

You never know what their list is for the day. 2.) if you're looking for healthy, look elsewhere. (Sometimes you have to say WTF.) 3.) Go for something with gravy...or a sauce.

I stopped by on a whim and immediately after walking through the door, I noticed the groups of people enjoying this delicacy so I knew it had to be good. The FOOD:The first day I ordered the Five and a Dime. Best thing since sliced bread. It is essentially a biscuit with succulent fried chicken breast, applewood bacon topped with an egg. Can't forget to mention the freshly made gravy that was every bit of perfect (EAT IT HOW IT SHOULD BE ATE, like a sandwich). The second time around, I ordered the sticky maple, which was another good choice. It was \u00a0a biscuit with fried chicken breast (JUICY), applewood bacon, and drizzled with maple syrup. I wish I knew who thought of this, but every thing I had was amazing. The iced cinnamon pecan biscuit was like a treat for my palette. It was the icing on the cake. The SERVICEFrom the first time I went to the second time I went, the service was nothing less than awesomeness. My first time going, the young lady at the cash register gave me the run down on how to order and what was a popular item. She was extremely polite and helped me out. She blew my mind when she asked, \"What's your favorite childhood cartoon?\" LOL.. After I got my meal, I began indulging in the goodness. Meanwhile, the manager walks up to me to make sure everything was good. I could barely get the words out to let him know everything was amazing.

I started eating my food and didn't realize until I was halfway through that I was missing my egg! They were extremely busy from the Cash Mob group, so I didn't say anything about it. Still, the biscuit was delicious. The gravy has bits of sausage in it and they gave me tons of it. Not one small corner of my biscuit was dry...and that's the way I like it! Unfortunately, I didn't care too much for the mac and cheese. I liked that they used cheese-its for the topping, but the overall flavor was lacking for me.My husband ended up getting something I was eyeballing on the menu, The Sticky Maple (biscuit, all natural fried chicken breast, pecan wood smoked bacon all topped with Bissell Family Farm real maple syrup). He was a little concerned with only getting one biscuit and no side, but as we figured out, he didn't need anything else because that biscuit was huge!

If you're going to do a crumbly topping on mac and cheese, it really needs to bake with that on top to meld the two together. Otherwise you have crunch on top of mush and that's a weird texture.

Virtual high fives.Upon entering, the place has a feel of serenity. The people in line are excited and everyone exudes a vibe of friendliness. Checked out the menu and settled on the Five and Dime. My partner in breakfast crime ordered the Sticky Maple. We both grabbed coffees. We were told fresh biscuits were in the oven and would take approximately 10-15 minutes, which was fine with us. We filled up on caffeine fuel and sat at the community table. As we sat there and took in the experience, we realized just how special this place is. Scott, who we would later find out is one of the owners, was all over the dining room floor, greeting guests, shaking hands and sharing a smile.We received our breakfast, as one of the servers brought it to us rather than calling out our name, which we were surprised by. But eager to partake in this delicacy, we made the first slice and went to a blissful place where endorphins found our pleasure buttons and jammed them like Neal Peart of Rush performing his legendary show. The food was amazing.The Five and Dime is a combination of chicken, biscuit, cheddar, a fried egg and the best sausage gravy I have had in years - and perhaps my life. The Five and Dime had a perfect amount of heat and the right amount of everything. Of course I sampled the Sticky Maple and was also surprised at its flavorful appeal. As we were eating, Scott came by and dropped off an Iced Cinnamon Pecan biscuit because he felt we waited too long. And we came to realize this is simply the person he is. As we drank our coffee (which was a great dark roast and I am a coffee snob), talked to other guests, and were formally introduced to Scott, we realized just how lucky we were. Nine months into business and this place is a masterpiece of genius proportions. What was impressive about Scott was his passion. You could see it in his eyes. He loved what he was doing and found joy in the success. One minute into the conversation, we learned his mission values. He shares it and breathes it in a time that others may say the values but do the converse. A sister store is apparently in the works and I asked him about franchise opportunities. Honestly, I would open one in a second in California - but only if I could run it as Scott and his team do - showing the same passion and fervor for food and life.

I researched the reviews on Yelp, and already thought in my head what I wanted until I read the menu on the wall! LoL I ordered The Garden Bird, a side order of Pecan Bacon (a must have), and orange juice (the lady at the register let me know it's free refills on the oj). Mr. Excitement was a bit of a challenge due to his gluten free diet; however, the lady at the register suggested a side order of 2 eggs & order of pecan bacon - awesome!

Yes I surprised myself! So when our order was ready - Hello Kitty was called and yelled out in the restaurant - Mr. Excitement went to get our order. LoL Now I know why this place had rave reviews - The food was delicious and well priced! The Garden Bird $6 had fresh hot just made out of the oven flaky biscuit nestled in between was the juicy piping hot fried crispy chicken that makes you want to say to the person next to you, \"shut your face!\" with greens and Louisiana hot sauce sprinkled on top of the yummy greens. The side of pecan bacon came with 4 pieces a must have but it seemed cold - I love bacon so I ate it anyway- omg good! Mr. Excitement saw they had their own coffee line called Maple coffee and got up and ordered.

I like 'em stuffed with whatevers on my plate and made into little biscuit sandwiches. Yum! Just give 'em to me. When I heard that a new breakfast spot had popped up with \"biscuit' right there in the name, I had to get over there pronto. Two of my best buds made the trek to San Marco with me this morning to check out Maple Street Biscuit Company, and, after passing the teeny tiny sign a few times, we finally found it and made our way in. First off, great, modern decor. They're going for a rustic, country feel, but how old-school can you be when you're ringing in orders on an iPad!?! Maple Street is a juxtaposition of simple and savvy, and that sentiment carried through the entire meal. After perusing the chalkboard menu, I really wanted my go-to of biscuits and gravy but, with so many cool options, I just couldn't go basic. Instead, I opted for The Garden Bird, a soul-food biscuit sammie comprised of fried chicken, an over easy egg, and collard green splashed with hot sauce. Son of a biscuit eater, that's crazy!! Since it was pre-10 am, which is practically pre-dawn for me, I also opted for a cup of the Dark Bark self-serve coffee. My biscuit came out stuffed and stacked high, with collard greens practically pouring out of it. My first thought was, yum! Followed directly by, how the fluff am I going to bite this thing?! Well, I managed, and it was awesome! Crispy, salty chicken blended beautifully with the juicy, seasoned greens, and the warm, fluffy biscuit held it all together like a comforting, buttery hug. (Which FYI are the best kinds of hugs.) At the suggestion of a few of the employees, we ordered sides of the homemade pepper jelly and apple butter and they were just as good as the sandwiches themselves! Highly recommend. Maple Street isn't the spot you'd go to for flapjacks and eggs benedict, but rather it's an experience all it's own.

As far as biscuits and everything contained in a biscuit are concerned, Maple Street pretty much has the market cornered in this particular field, and have transformed the everyday breakfast sandwich into a delightful work of art. Sadly, it took me forever to free up the time to get here, but it was SO worth the wait, as I was served up a dish of the best buttery biscuit deliciousness that I've had...EVER. Just Sayin': Being that their menu primarily consists of biscuits with indulgent accompaniments such as fried chicken, bacon, fried eggs, etc....my UBER-health-conscious mother was not with me on this venture, so I was flying solo. This is definitely not \"paleo paradise,\" if you know what I mean. So know that if you've yet to try it out.Eats: I was SO excited just to BE there, that I stood in front of the menu board forever pondering over this and that because frankly...there wasn't ONE thing that I didn't want to try. However, I've heard such good things about the \"Five and Dime\" (Flaky biscuit, all natural fried chicken, pecan wood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, sausage gravy with a little kick topped with a fried egg), that I couldn't resist choosing it for my first MSBC experience. And disappoint it did NOT. The chicken was not a tad dry, and the crispy texture provided the perfect contrast to the soft, melt-in-your-mouth biscuit. I also liked that the sausage gravy was off to the side of the plate, and not over the top of the sandwich, as it did not drown out the flavors and textures of the other components, and I could dip each bite at my leisure. Opinion? \u00a0As a whole, the dish was simply THE BOMB DIGGETY, and I'll never look at another breakfast sandwich the same.Word to the Wise: Your best bet...unless you like eating while standing up, is to be like me and come on a weekday morning. The weekends are jam packed, and parking is a nightmare. I snagged a seat on the patio and enjoyed the fresh morning air, plenty of people watching, and a wonderful meal.

Improvements (the addition of wood panels, an open layout, calming colors, and a self-service coffee area) have been made and the space is more inviting.We quickly agreed upon The Loaded Goat (flaky biscuit with fried chicken breast and a fried goat cheese medallion) and The Sticky Maple (flaky biscuit with fried chicken breast, pecan bacon topped with real maple syrup), and added two sides: grits and the Smoky Mountain Mac-N-Cheese.The signature biscuit sandwiches range from $4-7 and are filling. Sauces and other sides (sweet potato fries, collards, black eyed peas, salad, pepper jelly, butter, cheese, honey, apple butter, maple syrup, etc.) are additional. There are also coffee, sodas and tea.The biscuits themselves were good but not overly fluffy. The chicken was a generous portion, moist and not greasy. The creamy melted goat cheese was our favorite of the two toppings.The grits were good but needed to be stirred. We realized halfway through that there appeared to be cream cheese mixed in. The mac 'n cheese was good but not the best. The breadcrumb crust added a nice contrast to the cheesy noodles.I'd give MSBC a 3.5 out of 5. I want to go back and try some other items.

Dani V. finally gave me the last nudge I needed to get there. I invited my friend and we set out to find the elusive Maple Street Biscuit Company. It was tough because in my head I was thinking Maple or Soul Food Bistro? I've only been to Soul Food once, but I've been feenin those fried wings n things ever since. I fought the cravings...saying to myself: ill walk into maple, if i'm not feeling it, were going to Soul Food. It feels like a \"Country IKEA\" inside. As soon as i walk in, I glance at the plates coming up, I think to myself little biscuit, $7? hmmm overpriced chic-fil-a sammy? I started to study the menu and I guess it drew me in. and my friend looked pretty excited..the menu is pretty intense...bacon? fried egg? house pepper jelly? maple syrup? collard greens? hot sauce? I WANTED IT ALL! My two picks came down to The Farmer vs. The Sticky Maple. I asked the cashier (who I figured out was the owner) which was better? The Farmer (with Apple Butter) or The Sticky Maple (with Maple Syrup)? In my mind, I was swimming in a pool of maple syrup, but unfortunately, he said go with the Apple Butter. I said are you sure? you sure? I decided to trust him and fight my urges. When I came in to Maple, I expected my mind to be blown and blown it was! When the food came out it was like an oasis, it was overflowing with apple butter, the cheese was glistening, and that was a fat ass piece of chicken. The first bite blew my mind, that apple butter is the truth. You hit that flaky, fresh biscuit, that crunchy bacon, the cheese, that juicy chicken, then the apple butter gives you that sweet zing and ties it all together. I was shoveling that apple butter with my fingers hahahhah. Dani V. told me about there special \"Maple Tap\" Coffee. The description reads: Body: Medium As the name implies this has just a hint of maple in the roasting process. A must try. It was everything I thought it would be, thank you Dani! Plain jane coffee with a kick! The coffee is unlimited and you can get some to go! \u00a0They stack like 100 mugs on the counter it looks pretty cool and kind of dangerous at the same time. I talked to the owner, I asked him if he cared if I took pictures and he said fire away (i already took 50 pics but I wanted to talk to him) He was really nice, I talked to him about yelp and there new location at the beaches. I told him that we should have a Yelp event there or at the new beaches location. Hint, nudge, Allie, yeah! He gave me his card, I thanked him, and we were on our way. I'll definitely be back ASAP Rocky. Ruby A. talked about Iced Pecan Cinnamon buns in her review, they have house made pecan pie, I still have to try The Sticky Maple, and I could drink that Maple Tap coffee all day!P.S. When you order, they ask you a question? The question of the day was: What's your favorite part of Jacksonville? I said Riverside Arts Market because its awesome and I saw it in Daisy D.'s review hahahah. So when your order is ready they yell out your answer.

Although the construction traffic is enough to make you want to lay on your car horn, it is most definitely worth the trip. I admittedly was skeptical my first time here.

They're just biscuits!\" *sigh* I am now a proud member of the Too Excited Over Some Damn Biscuits club lol  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This lil' establishment is nothng fancy...I'm talkin' bout (free refill) OJ in small paper cups, people. You can't get any more simplistic then that. Very cozy interior; not as tightly packed as French Pantry because at least they have outside seating but if you catch it during rush hour, I'm sure you will either be sharing a table or taking your order to go. The staff makes up for the lack of interior design with a kind of playful character. As I'm sure you all have read before this review, MSBC has a cutie way of keeping track of their customers: they ask you a question and call you up based off of your answer. The question for my visit was \"Who was your favorite high school teacher?\" Mine was Coach Mac, my sociology, pscyhology and Western history teacher...he was also the tall, chocolate, extremely charasmatic football coach and oh em gee how I secretly loved him! Off topic? Yea I know...just my way of giving MSBC some major kudos for unintentionally reminding me of my old high school crush :-p My first time here, I kept it simple with The Sticky Maple: all natural fried chicken breast, pecan wood smoked bacon, topped with real maple syrup, sandwiched between 2 biscuits. Being a duty bound Southern Gal, I also ordered the Bluegrass grits as a side item (1 word: flawless). I have a theory whenever eating at a new place that I have intentions of visiting frequently: if they screw up the easy stuff or their signature items, then it's not worth a second attempt. Thank you MSBC for blowing this seemingly simple arrangement of breakfast items smooth out of the park! The biscuits were buttery, warm and flaky. The chicken was lightly fried to perfection i.e. no extra mushy breading, just crispy chicken with bold seasoning all the way through. The bacon was thick cut and very well done, just like I cook at home. Dontcha just hate it when you order bacon in a breakfast joint and there is a corner that is still borderline uncooked or when the bacon overall is browned but still limp? I DO. MSBC read my mind and hit the nail on the head :-) The maple syrup was the icing on the cake...literally. It was sweet but not HFCS sweet and deliciously messy. I found out the hard way how The Sticky Maple earned its name...but I just piled some napkins on my lap/chest and went to work on that lil monster lolNow my 2nd time was the mind blower. I went just a tad above and beyond by ordering The Squawking Goat: fried chicken breast, fried goat cheese medallion and house made pepper jelly, between 2 biscuits. First of all, what in the blue blazes is pepper jelly?! *frown* Oh, and go ahead and get your torches/clubs/pitch forks ready: I never had goat cheese prior to this place. ( I went here long before French Pantry...just wrote the review way late.)Yea, yea, yea....needless to say, this whole order was way out of my comfort zone. Never again will I doubt you, MSBC. The goat cheese was unlike any cheese I ever tasted! Scrumptious, kinda sweet and creamy goodness is the best I can come up with lol And the pepper jelly is nothing like the taste that came to mind...there is no trace of \"pepper\" in it's flavor. It's light and savory with a kind of kick to it...not spicy (to me), but definitely something that made my eyebrows shoot up like \"Wow! Never tasted that before...\". Believe me, it was exactly what the chicken biscuit needed to keep it from being boring after the first couple of bites and I am now a fan. Oh yea, I also had a side of \u00a0Smokey Mountain Mac n Cheese. It was pretty dang on tasty and they added a creative twist to it by putting Cheeze-Its on top.

My bf, Adam, loved his first visit to Maple Street Biscuit Company so much, he was sweet enough to drag me there the following weekend. It wasn't a big surprise (to me, at least) that I was pretty skeptical about a place that serves biscuits. The skepticism was really just the over-pouring jealousy clouding my vision.So that morning we went on our team training run in preparation for the Ragnar Relay and headed to Maple Street to refuel. Believe me, after that bridge run, I needed a biscuit or two or four or six.When we walked in, I was a little overwhelmed with their menu. I knew exactly what I wanted, I just needed to find it on there! Their menu is made up of unique names like The Ralphie or The Reinhold, so it's helpful to read through the entire description of the menu item to figure out what it really is.When we went to order, they actually recognized Adam and remembered that when he was in earlier that week, they were out of what he originally wanted to order, the pepper jelly. They let him know they had it in stock that day. It was just a little gesture, but it really won him over. It really just goes to show how friendly everyone is there.When you go to order, you don't give your first name for them to track your order. The first time we were there, we were asked for our favorite Band Name. The second time I went, they asked our favorite 80s TV show. Be aware, whatever the question of the day is, will be what they'll be calling out for everyone to hear.One tip is to pay attention so you can overhear the register ask the group ahead of you in line the question. This will give you an extra second to think of something so you don't blurt out the first embarrassing thing that comes to mind. I honestly feel this is really awkward because I feel everyone is judging my \"Huey Lewis\" and \"Silver Spoons\" responses. (Adam didn't know what Silver Spoons was?!?) I know I'm totally overreacting though. Also, don't be that jerk that think's it's super funny to get everyone to say the same thing. All this does is make things more difficult as everyone gets hungrier waiting for their food. I actually prefer to hearing them call out the different band names or TV shows rather than someone yell out everyone's first name over and over. I seem to be able to tune out a tv show or a rock band, but hearing \"jessica.... jessica...\" repeated just sticks in the back of my mind and interrupts my focus from my food.I ended up with The Ralphie, which is a fancy term for biscuits and sausage gravy. They also add \"a kick\" to theirs which I, of course, was skeptical of. In fact, \"the kick\" turns their gravy a slight pink color, which is really weird at first. After a few bites though, you totally won't care. It's delicious and \"the kick\" really, REALLY adds some good flavors to the dish. I could eat a whole bucket full of this stuff. (but then again, I'd have to run that bridge a bazillion times if I did that).Adam ordered the Squawk on the Street which is a biscuit, fried chicken breast, and the homemade pepper jelly (that they were out of the first time he went). He proclaimed it as very tasty. The pepper jelly added a sweet, not spicy flavor to the sandwich.The second time (Adam's third visit) we went, Adam was on a mission. He knew what he was ordering before we even stepped in the door! He immediately ordered The Five and Dime which is a biscuit, fried chicken, bacon and cheese topped with choice of gravy and a fried egg. He proclaimed it an epiphany of goodness in his face. His words, not mine. I think that means he liked it.I just got The Five so this was a biscuit, fried chicken, bacon and cheese topped with choice of gravy. aka same epiphany as Adam, but no extra egg. This was good, but I could have left off the chicken. It was flavorful and good, but I could take it or leave it. I think it's just not my thing. You might still think it's fabulous. It really hit the spot though. Seriously delicious after a good weekend long run.When we went the first weekend, we ran into our friends Ron and Tiffany and even Kerry. When we went this past weekend, we ran into Caron. It's definitely a place you'll run into people. They even have a big community table which makes it easy to meet up with a group of people if you'd like.For some reason, we completely missed the coffee hot-bar the first weekend. Caron pointed it out and talked highly of the Maple Tap. I'm not typically a huge fan of maple stuff, but Adam tried a cup.I went right for the Dark Bark. I really like bold coffee, so there was no reason for me to divert from what I typically like. Their Dark Bark was tasty. I tried the Maple Tap as well, and it was surprisingly good. It wasn't too strong on the maple, just right.Oh.. and \u00a0they make their biscuits from scratch right in the front for everyone to see.

Biscuits are no longer just for breakfast and Maple Street proves that!", "Date": "2013-04-29", "Author_Location": "Jacksonville, FL"}, {"Author": "Tracy B.", "ReviewID": "FnDo6uZ6HVTZq7T7NqKGUA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After seeing all the reviews for Maple Street, I had to try it! \u00a0TRUST the reviews -- they are spot on!! \u00a0My husband and I went on a Saturday and of course parking was a pain, but that was expected for this area. \u00a0If you can find a spot in front of the strip center, consider yourself lucky. \u00a0Otherwise, you'll eventually find street parking in the neighborhood behind the stores. \u00a0This is where we ended up parking, but it did make for a nice stroll. \u00a0There was a little bit of a line when we went, but it moved pretty quickly. \u00a0I love sausage gravy, so that was a no brainer for what I was going to order. \u00a0I got the Five--fried chicken, pecan wood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, and sausage gravy mounted between a flaky biscuit. \u00a0My husband got the Blues Biscuit -- pulled pork, cole slaw and bbq sauce on a biscuit. \u00a0When you order they have a quirky system where they ask you a question and your answer is what they call out when your order is up. \u00a0Listen to what they're asking other people, so you can think of a good answer. \u00a0Ours was, who was your favorite teacher? \u00a0There's plenty of places to sit either inside or outside. \u00a0They have it set up so there's communal tables. \u00a0Also, in the back there's another room full of smaller tables if there's no where to sit in the main area. \u00a0This is where we sat. \u00a0It was a little more quiet, but the problem with sitting back there was we couldn't hear our order being called. \u00a0After sitting for awhile, my husband finally went up to ask about our order. \u00a0He came back with our plates, but I was accidentally given the Sticky Maple. \u00a0Now don't get me wrong, this looked awesome and savory, but I really wanted to eat what I ordered. \u00a0My mission was sausage gravy and dang it, I was going to eat my sausage gravy. \u00a0I brought the dish back up and they got me my Five in less then five. \u00a0Honest mistake and quick turn around, so it didn't ruin the experience any. \u00a0This biscuit sandwich was to die for. \u00a0The fried chicken was perfectly crisp and juicy, seasoned to perfection. \u00a0The cheese and bacon added extra texture and flavor. \u00a0The biscuit was flaky and buttery. \u00a0The sausage gravy just took it a step up to oh my god level! \u00a0It was creamy, full of sausage and had just a little kick to it that made it more interesting then any other gravy I've had. \u00a0They really pile it on and it's a good thing. \u00a0Every bite you take is able to have a heaping pile of gravy on it. \u00a0My husband said his biscuit was really good. \u00a0Pulled pork and coleslaw always make for a delicious combo. \u00a0He did take a bite of mine and thought the chicken was so amazing, that he's definitely getting a biscuit with chicken next time. \u00a0We both ordered coffee with our meal. \u00a0We loved the set up of this. \u00a0It was like a coffee bar. \u00a0They had a variety of coffees and roasts with all the condiments. \u00a0What's great is they have mugs and to go cups. \u00a0The to go cups were so needed because their coffee was outstanding. \u00a0I think we both drank 3 cups and got a to go cup as well. \u00a0My husband enjoyed the Dark Bark, but I thought the clear winner was the Maple Tap. \u00a0It wasn't too overpowering and had just a hint of maple. \u00a0I think about that coffee all the time ::sigh:: \u00a0We tried to buy some the other day as they sell bags of whole beans. \u00a0They only had decaf....boo! \u00a0We did end up buying some Dark Bark and it definitely did not dissapoint. \u00a0This place knows what their doing with great quality food and freshly roasted coffee...I'm definitely a fan!", "Date": "2013-08-01", "Author_Location": "Jacksonville, FL"}, {"Author": "Gary P.", "ReviewID": "f6NgZk2JebJR68t736JCbw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Went there for breakfast and had the \"Ralphie Deluxe\" ......delicious!

The apple pie was just what you remember from Thanksgivings and other family gatherings, except its individual sized.
