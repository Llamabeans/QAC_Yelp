We've been there multiple times.The first thing you notice about this place is how packed it gets. \u00a0There is literally nowhere to wait for your table. The bar gets jammed packed. \u00a0It's almost impossible to get a drink while there given the amount of people eating at the bar and/or waiting for a table and/or drink. \u00a0You will also wait for a table well beyond your reservation time. Some times weeeeeeell beyond!!!!So why the 5 stars?!?!?! \u00a0Because once you get through the fact that the parking lot is so tight it was made for people who drive yugo's (they do have valet thankfully!), \u00a0and once you get through waiting way past your reservation in a small tight area with nowhere to go, you will experience a meal to remember.I love this place's food!!!

After reading the reviews, I was generally impressed, so I decided to try it out. Once entering Thai Spice, I \u00a0immediately realized the interior was unbecoming of the restaurants location, it was quite alluring. I was greeted by romantic mellow lighting and the pleasant sound of live piano music. There was also a couple of large salt water fish tanks filled with moving bright colors of life.But that is where the pleasantries ended...Perusing the menu I could not help but notice everything was grossly overpriced, even for this enticing place.I ended up ordering \u00a0the Lobster Pad Thai ($26) bit.ly/Opzyh9 and an order of Thai Spring rolls ($5.50) bit.ly/1gBHx1r .The Lobster pad thai was served with a very small lobster tail, a scant amount of noodles and very little vegetables. The Thai spicyness was missing, the dish was blandish and the noodles were oily. STAR RATING 3.0The Thai Spring rolls were average at best, there was nothing impressive about the appearance, taste nor texture. STAR RATING 3.0The service was decent, but nothing to be dancing about. STAR RATING 3.5The live entertainment was impressive. I was familiar with the young lady singing & playing the piano from a previous Yelp Elite event. She is angelic! STAR RATING 4.5-SUMMARYFood ~3 STARSAmbiance ~4 STARSPrices ~1 STAREntertainment ~4 STARSService ~3.5 STARSTo me the food is not worth any price, much less the price they are asking for.

Some things are just not meant to be, I suppose. Hate to go against the grain, but gotta share my experience.Now when you enter Thai Spice, it has a lot of promise. A dimly lit ambience that kinda makes you feel you're underground somewhere. There was live entertainment, a lovely lady on the piano. Incidentally, I have seen this pianist before so that was a pleasant surprise. As I take a look at the menu, I see all the familiar Thai dishes that I often crave. But then I get a not so pleasant surprise when I see that pad thai is $17, chicken curry is $17, any seafood dish is $20+...... what freaking alternate universe of fancy schmancy arm and a leg (and maybe even a kidney) pricing is this?! If they charge these prices, they must be serving the best damn Thai food EVER.Hate to spoil the ending, but it wasn't the best damn Thai food. It was pretty darn average. The pad see ew had nicely cooked noodles with a tasty sauce and veggies. Not a bad dish (still not worth the price). Our other entree was the samrod chicken which was forgettable. We also had the tom yum goong (seafood hot and sour soup). A few spoonfuls in, I find a hair. Not just a hair, but a questionably curly hair. Why oh why. I'll pass on paying high prices for being served hair in my food.

When you walk inside Thai Spice, it's another story. I originally heard many great things about this restaurant and there was a deal on Living Social, so that's why I tried it out. I went on a Saturday night for dinner with my boyfriend. There was live music in the bar area and the restaurant was busy. We were greeted by a friendly waitress who was very helpful with suggesting items to order. We started with the sesame chicken wings. These were the best chicken wings I've ever had. The waitress mentioned her uncle came up with the recipe. I ordered the skirt steak that came with bok choy and jasmine rice. It was a house speciality, so you could either a soup or a salad. My boyfriend ordered the three buddies that came with jasmine rice. His order was also a house speciality. When my skirt steak came to the table, I was shocked to see how huge the portion was. The presentation was also really nice. Overall - the waitress was really great, the service was really on point, and the food was really delicious.

Calamari came out and was awesome. \u00a0Lightly breaded, crispy with a nice sweet chili sauce. \u00a0Shortly after our salads came out and the waiter was nice enough to bring us both the peanut and ginger dressing. \u00a0I didnt bother with the ginger because I love their peanut dressing. \u00a0Its not as thick as other thai places Ive been too, but it has really good flavor. \u00a0As I said we were taking out time, so the waiter kindly reminded us that the kitchen will be closing soon, so he wanted to make sure our orders got in. \u00a0We ordered shrimp pad thai and green curry w/ fried tofu. \u00a0I normally order the panaang or red, but i do like green too, which by default is much more spicier than the others. \u00a0We sat enjoying the scenery, there was a nice fish tank in front of us, so really we just enjoyed every non-rushed second. \u00a0We could hear the singing of a girl in the \"Buddha Lounge\" in the background which was nice. \u00a0The waiter was very attentive, he saw we needed refills. \u00a0I went with a Jack Daniels on the rocks, but when you know him as long as I do, you refer to him as John Daniels (thanks Al Pacino). \u00a0Wifey had another Merlot. \u00a0Shortly after our food came out. \u00a0Pad Thai was good. \u00a0Not dry at all, nice flavor, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. \u00a0These were nice size shrimp, not the small ones for sure. \u00a0The green curry was also done just right. \u00a0Spicy but not too much, sauce was thick, tofu was crispy on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside. \u00a0I asked for a side of crushed peanuts and got a small bowl. \u00a0Definitely not skimpy. \u00a0I guess the benefits of eating slow and taking you time is you get full before you are done with your food and have plenty of awesome leftovers. \u00a0Yep, cant wait for it. \u00a0Overall experience was fantabulous. \u00a0Thai Spice never disappoints. \u00a0If you have never been here, you must try it. \u00a0 They really take the time to make your dining experience one that you will remember. \u00a0Dinner can get pricey, so if you want to try them out and not spend a lot of money, they have great lunch specials with the same quality and great service/atmosphere. \u00a0A true gem in South Florida. \u00a0What are you waiting for?", "Date": "2014-02-09", "Author_Location": "Miami, FL"}, {"Author": "Kevin C.", "ReviewID": "zf7QSsUse0fmVWoBrU0aYg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been driving by this place at least 6 months and finally got a chance to try it out one night. \u00a0Very romantic place with dark lighting and ambiance. \u00a0The Service is top notch! \u00a0We never had half a glass because the staff was always there to fill it up. \u00a0As always at a Thai restaurant I get the Curry Seafood plate. \u00a0And I always ask for the hottest spice which will always be \"Thai Spicy\". \u00a0It was hot and it did make me sweat however the favoring didn't quite make it to my standards.", "Date": "2014-03-13", "Author_Location": "Hollywood, FL"}, {"Author": "Maria G.", "ReviewID": "ZVLsSeIoPGU5G7hrPZTeiw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been to Thai Spice several times. \u00a0 I have always been pleased with the food.

The other food was awesome as well and I'd like to think I know a thing or two about Thai food being that both of my parents spent a significant amount of time in Thailand as refuges from Cambodia; my mother cooking lots of Thai cuisine for us growing up. We frequently returned over the 6-years following. I even brought my brother and mother when they came down to visit. My brother raved about the fried rice and my mother extremely enjoyed the crispy duck. I think we've tried every appetizer on the menu and they're all superb with exception of the chicken satay which was rather bland and the coconut shrimp which was mediocre at best. However, our last experience this past Sunday was less than stellar. We had a reservation for 7:30 but did not end up being seated until 8:10ish. This was okay by us, we were there for prime dinnertime service. But it only went downhill from there. Our server never introduced herself. Then, when she took our order, she didn't go over the specials with us as is usually customary (at least it was every previous time we've been, the last only 6-months prior). We ordered the spring rolls, chicken bites, and coconut shrimp as appetizers. The spring rolls, while delicious, did not come with the lettuce for wrapping as they normally do. No bother. They were still yummy. The coconut shrimp, on the other hand, were, as stated before, mediocre. We did not even finish them. The chicken bites were awesome. But ...Then came our entr\u00e9es. I ordered the pad siew with no bean sprouts. It came out and as I took my very first bite, I discovered what turned out to be a wadded piece of paper. It was sent back and a new plate was brought out, this time it had bean sprouts in it. Again, no worries, I just picked the bean sprouts out as, by this time, I was hungry. Someone, whom I'm assuming was the manager, came over to the table and pseudo-apologized. He stated that we'd be getting dessert on the house. Bleh. He didn't even stick around long enough for us to say thank you and decline, because I would have. We're not dessert people. At the end of our meal, a random dessert was brought out to us, without asking what we'd like. \u00a0It was flan. I detest flan. Luckily, I discovered, my daughter likes flan. But she's two. I only let her have a few bites (she had to go to bed at some point).Regardless, despite how hungry I was, I had some leftover and it was boxed up for us. Today, I attempted to eat the leftovers for a late lunch only to discover that the beef in my pad siew was covered with fat..I direct tweeted Thai Spice (along with a picture) and got the unsatisfactory response of it being a Groupon night -- whatever that means. Oh well, I suppose all good things must come to an end. It's such a shame because I really enjoyed them before, it seems, they got too big and important and acclaimed to focus on superior service and phenomenal food.", "Date": "2013-09-30", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "Danny H.", "ReviewID": "fzkwwwwlXt38VOGIX2CsmA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent Thai!

It was my turn to choose for date night...and I was in the mood for Thai...but didn't want to go too far from my house. After my meals, I usually want to sleep - don't judge me. So I asked my foodie sister to recommend some places. She did, but in the end decided to try a place that came highly recommend on Yelp - Thai Spice. Because it was Friday I called and made reservations for 8 to make sure that we wouldn't have to deal with the Friday rush.We got there a little early...7:45 to be exact, but figured we would just sit at the bar until it was time to eat. As it happened though, they seated us immediately...a two seater in the hallway. The place is decorated well, dark, with reds and booths, lighting is very dark and dramatic. We found out later that the space is quite small, but they used mirrors at the end of the rooms to make it appear larger. Don't expect bright light in here. The tables were lit with candles...we actually asked for a bigger one so that we could see our food better.Anyways, they gave us a list of the featured meals for the night AND their regular menu. The wine list is HUGE! I had a Lycheetini and He ordered Mangotini. The Mangotini was good...but the Lychee tini - Simply amazing. Clean crisp and they did not skimp on the Tini Part. Strong! We had two of those. On Drinks - I win!For the appetizer, he chose Seafood Coconut Lemongrass Soup - Medley of fresh shrimp, scallop, grouper, calamari, blue crab. \u00a0I had the Fresh Rhode island mussels - Simmered in a slightly spicy lemon grass broth with fresh basil and served with crispy naan bread. My Mussels were great - the sauce was sticky and sweet but delicious [all our food was ordered hot] you have a choice for the degree of heat you can have your meals at Mild, Medium Hot, and THAI hot. \u00a0Our server Marshall [ask for him - well spoken, attentive] explained it to us.Anyways I won on the drink choice - he did on the soup. It was delicious! We couldn't speak for a fewminutes after the first sip. A True medley of flavors - where none overpowered the other. It was fantastic. \u00a0- So much so that we had to stop eating it to so we would have a fair chance with the entrees.For the main meal I has shrimp red curry - Jumbo wild caught white shrimp saut\u00e9ed in red curry paste, coconut milk, zucchini, bamboo shoots, peppers, asparagus and fresh Thai basil. \u00a0He has the Sea Food clay pot - Jumbo wild shrimp, fresh diver sea scallops and Maine lobster tail simmered in a clay pot with exotic Thai herbs, garlic, wine, chili sauce and basil.We both won on these...but we couldn't finish!! We had to take most of it home. I had a double shot espresso afterwards just to give me enough energy to get to the car.Please, please try this place. The space is smallish, but the food more than makes up for it. There are booths outside too if you're interested in sitting outside in this Florida weather. \u00a0The place was packed the entire time we were there, but you didn't feel overwhelmed by the traffic at all. \u00a0Great for date night, but for groups too. \u00a0We could have shared a meal...and they let you.

That is really tough to say as I have eaten at thousands of establishments all over the world.  To be clear, your food is delicious, your staff was incredibly kind to my 89 year-old grandmother, but the waiter who waited on us was one of the worst ever. First off, the waiter does not know the menu. Which is sad, when your job is to know the menu. My grandmother wanted to order soup w/ her Pad Thai and he told her she couldn't...when it clearly said it comes with soup on the luncheon menus. Then, my grandmother asks for a straw to share my tea, and he comes back with said straw and shoves it in her soup bowl. Because clearly, all old people want to sip up their hot soup from a straw. Just because she is in a walker, it doesn't mean she is paraplegic. She felt disgusted that he would generalize like that and that he would just plop the straw in her soup, without even handing it to her. Really weird stuff. Then, when *I* ask for the check, he makes a BIG DEAL to plop in front of her. Because clearly, as a \u00a0mixed-race black woman, I am either my grandmother's aid or too poor to pay. It was really uncalled for to have this waiter make an assumption of who was to pay. Usually, when the wait staff is properly trained, they place the check in the middle of the table. I leave my debit card with the waiter, and my grandmother watched as he swiped my card 3x in a row without a break. She couldn't believe it. And the he comes back and says that my card is declined...which is complete bullshit. I have plenty of money in my account and was just at the bank. I know my finances very well. \u00a0I asked for a read-out from the machine and he says the machine doesn't do that. I wanted proof that my card was declined and he just stared at me blankly. He said he ran it twice and it was declined and there was nothing he could do. Instead of giving access to any more of my cards, I pay cash and we leave. My level of trust is completely gone. On our way home, my bank calls to say that someone at Thai Spice/Tatton ran my card at least 3x. I have TWO charges of $27.40 deducted from my account. So I LOVE that he says my card is declined, while $27.40 \u00a0went through twice. If I had no money in my account, clearly that wouldn't have happened. My bank says it would have gone through a THIRD time, but they halted the activity before the waiter could. I think your waiter needs to (a) learn the menu (b) take sensitivity training (c) learn not to generalize people and (d) learn how to use a credit card machine. He is not equipped to represent your establishment nor serve its guests.", "Date": "2013-07-19", "Author_Location": "Beverly Hills, CA"}, {"Author": "Tiffany H.", "ReviewID": "jt5QmaUhSlDCH-F0xZV-1w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BEST THAI AROUND!!!

They bragged for weeks, so I had to go myself. I arrived on a weekday lunch around 12:30 to find the small parking lot packed to the gills with other cars hawking for a spot. After circling a couple times I saw a sign stating that there was more parking in the back of the restaurant. In the back I found at least 10 free parking spots. Because they were so busy and I was dining alone, I sat at the bar so that I didn't take a table that they probably could use for a larger party. The bartender, Shawn, quickly greeted me and laid a linen napkin out on the bar before he brought my jasmine tea and silverware. He was very welcoming and helpful in choosing an entree. His impeccable service contributed to the five-star rating. I probably haven't had such great service in years, not to mention in the lunch hour. He explained the history of the restaurant and I now understand that it started as a small takeout restaurant that expanded by slowly buying adjoining store spaces over the years. Looking at the restaurant they have created, I would have never guessed that it started as a takeout. The restaurant is very cut up with many private nooks and tables all decorated in Asian inspired black and reds. There are so many beautiful fish tanks, you are certainly guaranteed a view of one wherever you sit. I bet kids would love it here. I ordered the ginger salad and red curry with steak and vegetables(lunch portion). The homemade salad dressing was awesome, although I haven't had iceberg lettuce in a long time. I would have much preferred a hydroponic or leaf lettuce, but the dressing made the salad enjoyable. The entree was the star of the meal with slices of steak so tender they seemed to partially melt in my mouth. The vegetables were cooked perfectly as they were hot, \u00a0tender, and still with a bit of crunch. The sauce was the best Thai curry sauce I have ever had. It had a very complex flavor in that I tasted different spices and ingredients as I enjoyed each bite. Light coconut milk flavor, with Thai basil that gave the hint of anise or fennel. The large square plate was portioned with just the right amount of sauce that I didn't have a dry bite or a drop left, hehe (honestly, I would have considered scraping the plate).Between the awesome service, the beautiful decor, and the sauce that made me want to smack my momma, this place ROCKS!!!

The seafood was cooked perfectly and the green items had a nice bright color to them.My partner had the shrimp pad thai, I am guessing that it was good since he ate the whole thing and did not save me a bite!Overall a very excellent meal!Will eat here the next time we are in Ft.

Had I been alone I might have kept driving thinking it was a little overboard. The friends we were with were absolutely sure this was the place for me and they were right. From what I was told, it has recently been remodeled. It is obvious when you pay close attention. You enter through the swankier new area. If you make a right once inside you can see the difference in decor. It is a family owned restaurant with the owner, wife and daughter being all hands on deck. I did something I rarely do: I let others lead the way and order for me. I know, I know, I really need to do this more often. This was a great first step for me because everything that came our way, and I mean every little morsel was delectable. This is what I we tried:Bangkok RollsCoconut ShrimpChilean Sea BassLobster Pad ThaiRibeyeSeafood Medley SoupSpecial Fried RiceWhite Chocolate CheesecakeCoconut Fried Ice CreamChocolate Peanut Butter MousseYes, all of that was for just four of us. It was our own version of \u00a0a \"family style tasting menu\". The portions are pretty large for the entrees and regularly sized for appetizers and desserts. Some things are Thai hot and others milder. If this is not your thing, make sure to ask prior to ordering. I do love \"hot\" so I was very happy. It's hard to choose a favorite but I would say the Bangkok rolls and lobster pad Thai were the most memorable for me. The chocolate peanut butter mousse was spectacular as well.

I rotate between the pad thai and the pad siew, mostly because I love noodles so much I just can't seem pull myself away. The sweet peanut taste in the pad thai is perfect and the sweet soy sauce in the pad siew is amazing. They are totally willing to customize spice level, but I'm not that adventurous with spice so I always get mild.The other night I tried dinner here for the first time. \u00a0 They offered a groupon a month or so back, so I snatched it up, a good opportunity to try dinner for essentially the price of lunch. I made reservations since it was Friday night, and I'm glad I did. The parking lot was quite full and we had to valet, and we did have to wait a few minutes for our table despite the reservation, but it wasn't long and I wasn't bothered by it.I started with one of their signature drink. This was the first opportunity I had to try anything from the bar since I've only ever been here when I have to be back at work. I don't remember the name but it was essentially an apple cinnamon martini...so good! and the taste reminded me of fall. We ordered the grilled calamari appetizer as well. I'm somewhat new to calamari, especially if its not fried, because the potential is had to be chewy scares me. This was was cooked perfectly, and the grilled/charred taste was excellent. It came with two sauces, one fairly spicy and one mild that went really well. For dinner I ordered pad siew and my boyfriend ordered pad thai. I somehow talked him into this because I really wanted to order both. The pad siew was perfect as usual. He ordered the pad thai spicier than I would normally, but trying it the flavor was really good and the spice went well with the peanut sauce, I just know I couldn't handle the whole portion. I love how the noodle dishes come with fresh bean sprouts on the side, they're great mixed it. I've always had good service here for lunch, and there was nothing really wrong with the dinner service, I just felt it had been more attentive on occasions I went during the day, but this is probably because they were busy. Overall I was pleased with the dinner, but I do have to say that lunch portions are not much different, and the price is lower and the dishes come with salad, so lunch is a better value by far.

What Thai restaurant serves prime beef grilled to perfection like this....I really had to think about it and no other Thai Restaurant came to my mind. The steak was served with a Tiger Tear sauce which was I think was a mix of soy sauce, fish sauce and some herbs. This sauce had a unique taste and gave the steak an interesting favor even though it tasted great without it. The mango sorbet was a perfect ending to a great lunch. Cool, refreshing, and sweet.

Agree that it's a great place to introduce someone to Thai food, and for a business lunch. The thai food does not seem the most authentic ever, but that doesn't mean it's not of very high quality and very good. We went here again today, the waiter \"recommended\" a steak or the lamb chop entrees for lunch. Both are around $30. Instead, since we were at a Thai restaurant and came there for Thai food, we all ordered Thai food from the lunch special menu! I bet the steak is good, though. Prices on that lunch special menu range from about $8 to around $13. Most other entrees are more expensive. The Pad Thai (also around $10) is good, but not on that menu, so it doesn't come with anything. Whereas the lunch special items come with rice and either the soup of the day or salad. The soup today was hot 'n sour: pretty standard but good. Service is friendly, sometimes a little slow but that didn't surprise me because they were packed for lunch as usual. \u00a0Agree with another reviewer's recommendation to get there before 12 or after 1 and avoid Friday's. Parking can be a hassle and sometimes there's a wait.Regarding today's food, a coworker had the panang curry ($9.95), which had a delicious coconut milk sauce and vegetables such as asparagus, green and red peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc. I got the same dish but paid the extra $2 for shrimp, and was not disappointed. The shrimp were good size and tasty. All four of us who dined asked for our meals medium spicy and agreed that it was just enough kick to give it a pleasantly-spicy taste but to not be uncomfortable.

(Short sentences for dramatic effect - I'm trying to think of something polite \u00a0say.....) Now, I'm not a big fan of Karaoke, but I recognize many others are. \u00a0Fine. \u00a0And I enjoy live music when the musicians are, are, well, top-notch. \u00a0But is it too much to ask, in a \"destination\" (that adjective is on their website) restaurant that has four distinct rooms, to have regular music where people are eating, and keep the (abrupt colorful adjectives deleted to continue to be polite) \"singing\" (oops...couldn't help myself) confined to the bar area? \u00a0C'mon? Please? \u00a0For three blissful minutes the \"singer\" paused and the music switched to something current, professionally assembled and pleasant. \u00a0So I had three good minutes in the evening, otherwise, the ambiance sucked, er, I mean, had an air of 70's throw-back crossed with high school talent show.My apologies in advance to any waitstaff there who take their jobs seriously. \u00a0Unfortunately, we weren't seated in your station. \u00a0I wish we had been. \u00a0The man who swept us off the entry threshold almost prevented us from a bad evening. \u00a0He was so pushy and unaccommodating, if he hadn't finally seated us in the dining room after showing us two different tables in the exceedingly loud and completely customer-desolate bar after we repeatedly asked for \"a quiet table where we could talk,\" we would have walked out before even being seated. \u00a0Alas, we were paraded thru the entire restaurant \u00a0and given a table next to the kitchen. \u00a0Nothing says \"quiet romantic evening\" quite like a banging kitchen door and constant foot traffic.And that was just the beginning - it gets worse! \u00a0Our waiter and his little helper were two of the least professional waitstaff I have ever encountered in a restaurant where you don't retrieve your food off of a counter after your name is called. \u00a0Our drinks - nothing fancy, just Thai iced teas - took about 13 minutes to arrive. \u00a0By this point, we knew what we wanted to order, but Mr. Waiter insisted on reciting the specials. \u00a0After the unwarranted litany, we ordered the veggie red curry and grilled organic free range chicken. \u00a0 Yes, the food took an inordinately long time to arrive. \u00a0When it did, the presentation was disappointing. \u00a0The curry was served family style. \u00a0The chicken and its accoutrements adorned a platter sized for a Viking king. \u00a0This doesn't look awkward in front of a guy with wide shoulders, but ladies, don't go there - you'll look like a troughed hog. Despite both meals being ordered \"medium spicy, \" they were both not at all spicy. \u00a0They tasted fine, but nothing warranted the prices. The baby bok choy with garlic was perhaps the highlight.Twenty minutes ~after~ we placed our silverware in the 4 o'clock \"we're finished\" position and pushed the plates to the end of the table, Mr. Waiter checked in to see if everything was ok. \u00a0\"Yes, we've finished. The check please.\" \u00a0Ok - check this out! \u00a0Mr. Waiter left our table carrying one little glass and we waited another five minutes for his little helper to cart away the rest of the plates. \u00a0Seriously! \u00a0Has anyone ever seen that before, because I certainly haven't. \u00a0Then, the little helper comes back and interrupts our conversation to request I hand him a spoon that was tucked away by the salt and pepper. \u00a0Really? \u00a0You want me to help clear the table in a \"destination\" restaurant? \u00a0After the ten minute clearing process (thirty minutes now since we finished eating) Mr. Waiter comes back to ask if we want dessert. \u00a0\"No thank you, just the check please.\" (Didn't we ask for that ten minutes ago?) Finally, we do get the check. \u00a0But! \u00a0We also get a spiel about birthday specials and filing out comment cards. \u00a0Let me emphasize this: birthday specials and comment cards in a \"destination\" restaurant. \u00a0Wow.There is a reason why there are no accolades past 2010 on their web page . \u00a0I don't know what that reason is, a change in ownership or management, perhaps? \u00a0But the accolade-givers have known all along what I just experience first hand.

YUM!Coco Shrimp dipped in tempura batter and rice noodles and served with the most very light velvety honey mustard sauce, best I've ever tasted. Drink: Thai Ice Tea, another yum and my new favorite drink... Lemon Drop Sake-Tini \u00a0(Martini made with Sake) Hallelujah!!!!!Now for the main course...Triple Main Lobster Tails in a Thai Garlic Lemongrass butter sauce and vegetables. Words can not express how amazing this dish was. But the lack of words can... my friend and I sat there all of sudden speechless, there were occasional moans of ecstasy coming from us but that's about it. It is on the pricey side, but for original prepared dishes, Thai dishes that are created a little outside of the normal thai box makes every penny worth it, especially matched with great service, and a very extensive menu.", "Date": "2011-03-12", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "Anthony G.", "ReviewID": "h3N8ZB9Orob-jnvCVOW9Dw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Adequate, clean and has good service. \u00a0But not the best.Lunch prices are reasonable; otherwise, it is somewhat pricey. \u00a0Food is good, although a bit bland. \u00a0(\"Medium\" was VERY mild for example.) \u00a0Food was good, but not spectacular. \u00a0Panya Thai on 163rd is a LOT better in all respects and is about the same price.", "Date": "2011-02-23", "Author_Location": "Miami, FL"}, {"Author": "Jeff P.", "ReviewID": "lhlWABvMucGzwW2VnetWyA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This place was not for me. I felt the food was very Americanized and not authentic. It's almost like a fusion steak house-thai restaurant-seafood restaurant as opposed to an authentic Thai restaurant. For example, they serve steaks, pork chops and seafood in addition to Thai food. \u00a0They also serve dishes that are popular in Asia in general such whole fried fish which is very popular in China. They also serve salads with some of their meals. I didn't care for the ambience. I feel the restaurant is too small and I felt claustrophobic. The tables were too close together and I could hear the conversation of the people seated behind me. The waiting area is tiny in my opinion. There were not enough seats and we stood for nearly 45 minutes waiting for a table. Speaking of which, I would definitely not recommend this place for families particularly for those with small children as there is little space for strollers and the long waiting times would make your night very challenging.  The place is located in a tiny strip mall so the parking is also limited. Many people have to wait for others to leave before getting a spot. Finally, the service was pretty lackluster. Our waiter was not very attentive nor friendly. The food was \u00a0good but not great. The pad thai had too much egg and peanuts. Their curries and sauteed dishes were very watery with overly large thick chunks of vegetables. Nonetheless, for me, it's too much trouble to dine here. I'm not willing to drive to Oakland Park and compete for parking in a tiny strip mall and then wait another hour in line for pretty good but not great Thai food. I don't really care about wine pairings and unique salads when I approach Thai food. I think the main reason it is so popular is there are not many quality Thai restaurants in the area, and their lounge vibe really works for many people.

\u00a0They didn't even have steak, when I used to go there. \u00a0But sure enough, not only they have steak, they have Prime Dry Aged steak. \u00a0Some great steakhouses don't even have dry aged steak. \u00a0So I got the 22 oz Cowboy steak, bone in rib eye. \u00a0This was a very thick cut steak, about 3 inches. \u00a0Because it was dry aged there wasn't a lot of fat left on the steak, most of that gets lost in the aging process. \u00a0They cook it over a very hot open flame and get a nice char to it. \u00a0I ordered it medium rare, but it came out more on the rare side. \u00a0This was fine for me, but for others might be a problem. \u00a0I like rare steak, just as long as it's hot - I'm good. \u00a0The seasonings are very very bold. \u00a0Almost flavor overload. \u00a0They didn't want to tell me exactly what they rubbed all over it, just said it was Thai herbs and ginger garlic soy sauce. \u00a0Well, whatever the Thai herbs were, it was one of the most seasoned steaks I've ever had. \u00a0But that isn't where it ends..it's served with their Tiger Tear dipping sauce. \u00a0I'm guessing it's made from fish sauce, soy sauce, red chili paste, coriander, \u00a0lime juice. maybe some brown sugar. \u00a0It's very spicy, but I didn't mix it up. \u00a0When I poured the remaining sauce on some white rice, I got a lot of the chili at the bottom and it went from very spicy, to \"get me some water now!!!\" Hot. \u00a0Yes it will make a Tiger Cry. \u00a0Served on the side was some amazing Bok Choy. \u00a0This was also quite spicy as it was sauteed in chili oil.If you don't want to break the bank with one of their $40 steaks, they have plenty of traditional Thai dishes in the $15 range. \u00a0Their curries are outstanding. \u00a0My wife has always really liked the Pad Woonsen, a thin bean noodle dish sauteed with mixed vegetables, egg, and either chicken, pork, or beef. \u00a0Thai Spice has plenty of different seafood dishes on their menu, you'll have a hard choice picking between them.Sometimes when you fall in love with a restaurant, but then move away, you start to think it's better than it really was. \u00a0Coming back to Thai Spice after all this time, I can say that, it's just as good as I remember it . \u00a05 stars all the way.", "Date": "2011-04-12", "Author_Location": "Fullerton, CA"}, {"Author": "Eric D.", "ReviewID": "5Wl9GxwETpOrb8uwB2JDMQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Thai Spice is a decent Thai restaurant that has been slightly Americanized. \u00a0This was made apparent when they had zero Thai desserts available. \u00a0Not what I expected from what on the outside (d\u00e9cor and main dishes) appeared to be an authentic Thai restaurant.Atmosphere - Swadee Thai...elephants w/ trunks up, Buddha's galore, teak inspired coloring on the wood carvings and lots of fish tanks. \u00a0I felt I could have been in Bangkok.Food - I had the Yum Nua (Spicy beef salad) my standard test dish of Thai restaurants (yes, this is now a science). \u00a0The dish came w/ sliced grilled beef, red onions, tomato, cucumber, red peppers, cilantro and lime juice...oh and a nice purple flower. \u00a0It was good as expected. \u00a0Only complaint is that the dish was a little too watery making it difficult to eat. \u00a0For my main dish I had the Green Curry Chicken which came w/ chicken (duh!), green curry paste, coconut milk, zucchini, bamboo shoots, pepper, green bean pods and fresh Thai basil. \u00a0It was tasty and although I am not a big fan of green pea pods in my dish it was on par with a great and a higher priced Thai restaurant that I went to while in London. \u00a0While I love spicey, the waiter was kind enough to steer me away from Thai Hot to a more subtle level of heat. \u00a0He even brought out a little dish of assorted spices if I want to turn up the heat. \u00a0Yo, momma!!Service - Prompt and lots of refills on my water (the food was spicy). \u00a0Waiter was conversational and helpful w/ my selections. \u00a0 \u00a0Overall - a nice restaurant, although not a 100% traditional Thai restaurant, it will definitely appeal to your first time Thai diner.", "Date": "2008-10-08", "Author_Location": "Cornelius, NC"}, {"Author": "Nina C.", "ReviewID": "H5OZ8lz3hpJgfViVkoC3ww", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Anyone who doesn't give this place 5 stars is a complete retard and doesn't deserve to eat period!!!

Luckily the manager came by and asked how everything was going. I told him I appreciated him coming over and he said he would fix the situation. At first he didn't quite understand what I was saying I guess. I told him that I ordered spicy food and it was a problem to not have water refilled at all. I then told him I had to go so far as to ask the bus boy for a refill and he had taken care of it. The manager responded with: do you want more spices on the side?

( new suggestions appreciated ) . I moved into the area less than three weeks ago, and last night was my second attempt after scanning Internet reviews and delivery menus of local Thai restaurants. \u00a0Iv had Thai from a few other places in Florida since I moved here from NYC a few months ago and sadly I have to say it goes the same for the pizza, \u00a0I just haven't found one that iv truly been satisfied with so far. hoping to prove my analysis wrong, and still determined for pad Thai I ordered a delivery order from Thai spice. \u00a0An order of pad Thai chicken (15) 2 coconut milk soups ( 4.5 x 2 ) and a pint of brown rice ( unknown ) came to $32.50 , even for being regularly comfortable with NYC prices I thought that was a lil high but at the time I didn't really care, until .. After eating the first bite of chicken, and then ripping all of the pieces apart, it was clear to me that the meat was not fully cooked, I called back and there was no answer , it said open till 10 it was 10:01. \u00a0Today I had called , explained to them my disappointment with my order and they resent a new order of chicken pad Thai that I asked to be cooked well done this time. \u00a0The order they sent back was in the same size container though only half way full, and again the chicken was rubbery on the inside and not grainy like it should look fully cooked. So I paid 15 for basically an order that I did not get to eat. My conclusion on Thai spice is completely over priced for service that they are inaccurate to provide. I'd ADVISE checking your meat thoroughly most disease are ingested into the bodily system by dead cells hosting parasites that feed and harness themselves in the corpesd carcases \u00a0of dead animals.
