We ordered the prime set which was nice (small) set of wagyu. The wagyu set was as advertised; quality cuts. Still hungry, we ordered another set of regular cuts. Minus the kalbi they were tough and tasteless. The prepared food that came with our meat set was rather uninspiring and bland. The California rolls rice was hard and had almost no guts to it. The salad was ice cold (almost frozen) and the Goma dressing was watered down to the point of no taste.

After taxes and tip, it came out to $30 per person. The quality of the meat was not the finest but it was good and reasonable for the price. The downside of the combo is that it does not come with any side dishes and those items need to be ordered separately (it's very un-Korean, most Korean restaurants give sides for free). The pork katsu was standard and it was just good as well. The best part of our meal was the 27.7 degree Sapporos. Super chilled with a film of ice on the top.

As I think back to that moment in time, I remember thinking it was expensive and that I would rather go to a real, deal Korean BBQ place so that I could stuff my face with yummy banchan instead of having to pay for kimchi a la carte. Booooo! Give me bottomless, free banchan you broom-riders!I have always resisted my hubbie's pulls to take me back there, but last night I ran out of excuses. After being disappointed by the restricted pool access at XS, we were hungry. We went to Red 8 and waited 10-minutes for someone to say \"Ni hao,\" before we said \"Z\u00e0i Ji\u00e0n!\" We were with Mamie P and her old man, who likes beer, so the selling point was 27.7-degree beer at Yagyu! This is a brilliant, beautiful thing they have there: beer so cold that little beersicles form on the top of your glass. They have a couple of Japanese brews and Sin City Light. We tried out the Sin City Light, and it wasn't bad. Then again, mud beer served that cold would probably taste just fine too.As a crew, we ordered 3 rounds of kalbi, 1 beef tongue, a cucumber kimchi, a seaweed soup and a yukke jan soup. To me, the standouts are the soups. Even when I thought I didn't like the place, I thought the soups were delicious with a real comfort food feeling, and they are reasonably priced. The seaweed soup is like four bucks, and it is not a teeny bowl. It has a really great sesame flavor. I only ate two little slices of kalbi, but they were tender and flavorful. The delivery is much neater than Korean BBQ, and the serving sizes are smaller but cheaper. You receive about 10 slices on a small white platter for around eight bucks. The kimchi was a bit disappointing. The flavor was okay, sadly more sweet than spicy, but they bring it out sliced like big half pickles. You have to figure out how to navigate a gigantic pickle with chopsticks! I did not enjoy this.Even so, I think I have come around on Yagyu. It is a cute spot. The servers are friendly, and being open until 2am it serves a wonderful post game purpose: to slam down one or three last cold ones and get your late night protein snack on. Or, you can always go there for some soup.

Aside from the regular beef, the restaurant also have Kobe beef as an upgrade. \u00a0Upgrading to Kobe beef, just means you get beef that have more intramuscular marbling, which means even more tender meat from a former pampered cow that drank beer, gets regular massages, and generally lived a very good life. \u00a0Since it is a DIY barbecue at your table, do expect to leave the restaurant with the pleasant barbecue smell after the meal. \u00a0I know they have pretty good ventilation system, so it is not too bad. \u00a0Just something to remember, especially if you have a business meeting to attend after your meal.Price-wise, it is definitely more expensive compared to some other Asian barbecue restaurants in town. But enjoying yakiniku is generally a pricier treat for your mouth and tummy, and you do generally have better quality and cuts of meat. \u00a0But they do offer various combinations, which can feed 2-3 people of normal appetite, or one Tony T (yeah, that's me!). \u00a0Selecting the combo is also a good way to try out all the different cuts of meat, until you know which cuts you prefer and can order it a la carte.The waitresses here are very friendly and attentive. \u00a0I have never had a bad experience dining here, whether in a large party or solo. \u00a0The restaurant is usually not super busy when I go, but calling ahead for reservation is still recommended.If you see Groupon or LivingSocial promotions for Yagyu Yakiniku, do take advantage of it. \u00a0Which helps make a meal here more wallet-friendly. \u00a0With or without these promotions, a meal at Yagyu Yakiniku is still a fantastic experience.Food: \u00a05/5Service: \u00a05/5Price: \u00a03.5/5 \u00a0Ambiance: \u00a04/5Parking: \u00a03/5 \u00a0It is located in a very bustling plaza, so parking can be an issue at times, but if there are no spaces in the front, try behind the building.Overall 4/5.", "Date": "2011-07-13", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Bobby Y.", "ReviewID": "m2G-PshNq5CRJBHQrf_boQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This place is open late, and the quality of the a la carte Korean BBQ meats are top tier. The grills in the center of the tables are a charcoal and gas combo. The charcoal makes the grilling a little more challenging than say, the non-stick gas 'domes' at The Honey Pig, but the flavor from good ol' coal is hard to beat.We've eaten at Yagyu 7 or 8 times this past year and on a few occasions it seems as though our Kalbi order came out to our table as Prime Kalbi at no extra charge - the meat was intensely marbled. Maybe the restaurant ordered too much Prime Kalbi that week? Their regular Kalbi is gristle-free: consistently the leanest Kalbi I've experienced. At Yagyu, one order of Kalbi ($7) is 11-12 boneless pieces. Boneless Kalbi is unusual and I like it. (It is always awkward when we order Kalbi somewhere else and the server puts the Kalbi bones on the grill last, as if gristle, cartilage and marrow are some kind of bonus course. I always feel less 'Asian' when I realize I don't enjoy gnawing on short rib bones. In those situations I usually end up spitting out the undigestible wad of short rib cartilage after I chew on it for a minute. This will never happen at Yagyu.)At Yagyu we recently discovered the harami (outside skirt) which tastes as good if not better than the Kalbi. The Dinner for Two ($26) is HUGE!! It comes with a staggering amount of food, including soup, salad, an assortment of fresh sushi, a generous assortment of katsu dishes, a bunch of banchan sides, several different meats to grill plus vegetables and I think I'm forgetting like 2 or 3 other items that come with it. Usually we don't order the 'Dinner for ___' at Asian restaurants, but this one is not to be overlooked!I really, really like the Wakame (3.95) seaweed soup. It is served in a big bowl - could almost be a meal in itself.In addition to food, Yagyu serves 29-degree draft beer. This beer is so cold that a thin sheet of slush floats suspended in the frosty beer glass. 29 degrees would make even a Schlitz (not available) taste great and transformed the Sapporo (available) that I ordered into the coolest Sapporo experience one could have. We have done a lot of winter touring during which we've practiced sticking longneck beers in snowbanks next to hot tubs, creating a 'snow bar' of cold beer. Amazingly, Yagyu's is even colder. Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.Yagyu is never super busy when we go. Ichiza (upstairs) is always slammed!

I discovered many other Yelpers had reviewed this place and gave it decent reviews. \u00a0Comforting. \u00a0We went for option B of the Japanese BBQ, which includes a variety of meats and sauces, 8 pieces of sushi, miso soup, rice, and various sides. \u00a0When it came out, we realized it had both Japanese and Korean components. \u00a0For example, it comes with kimchi. \u00a0The BBQ is gas but they threw some charcoal in it, which I believe is traditional for Japanese BBQ.And when we got our meat it was like moving up from the kids' table! \u00a0After living her for six years, I have yet to find a Korean or Japanese BBQ place that will let me cook my own meat. \u00a0But here it was all up to us, or to my husband I should say because he's the cook. \u00a0All the meats were really good and tasted fresh. \u00a0Most of the BBQ options come with beef tongue. \u00a0Don't be afraid. \u00a0It's really good, especially with the lemon juice and sesame oil. \u00a0Personally, I'll eat anything so I don't care.The grill is curved which made cooking some of the food, especially the round pork sausages, a little interesting. \u00a0They kept rolling off! \u00a0After we finished, they immediately brought the check. \u00a0I guess they don't serve dessert. \u00a0So we headed off to Tea Station for that. \u00a0Or tried. \u00a0I couldn't open the door to leave. \u00a0I pushed my hardest but it just wouldn't budge.

The salad dressing had some lovely overtones of yuzu with wonderful fresh ingredients.

It's set up so that each table has their own barbecue grill built into the table, and the whole room was actually done up pretty well. We had plenty of time to notice our surroundings because there seemed to be only one waitress in the whole place. There were two other tables seated, and though she glanced at us twice while she was serving the other tables, she never even attempted to tell us that it would be a moment or anything. After 5 or 10 minutes, she seated us, and we sunk into the comfy booths. We perused the menu, and ultimately decided on the Yagyu Combination A (26.95) and the Yagyu Special (19.95).It was another wait again, and before long we were brought our food. The Combination A came with Harami, Kalbi, Chicken, and Shrimp. In addition, it also came with four varieties of Sushi rolls (California, Spicy Tuna, Salmon Avacado & Spicy Shrimp), an appetizer plate (Chicken Karage, Ton Katsu, and Pork Gyoza), a salad, a miso soup, a bowl of rice, and four sides (Edamame, Kim Chi, Seasoned Radish, and some random thing I couldn't identify).The meat was pretty good, but there just wasn't enough of it. They were good cuts, and actually cooked pretty quick. The chicken was definently my favorite, as it had a nice flavor to it.The sushi was TERRIBLE.

I couldn't even tell if there were actually four different kinds of sushi because they all looked and tasted the same.The appetizer plate was actually really enjoyable. The chicken Karage was the best part of the meal, and the ton Katsu was actually pretty good as well. The gyoza were over-cooked and entirely too crispy though.The salad and miso soup were absolutely disgusting, as were the four sides. The edamame were extremely stiff, and I'm admittedly not a huge kim-chi fan.The Yagyu Special was much better, because it was solely a large helping of Harami, Kalbi, and Rosu meat. None of the meat was seasoned, so it was slightly bland since the only available sauces were Teriyaki, Soy, and Syriacha, but it wasn't too bad.Overall, this place is ENTIRELY too expensive for just mediocre food.

He is the long reigning Super Bantamweight Champion of the world. No boxer from America, Latin America, or Europe has ever come close to beating him. Did you know that he frequently eats at YAGYU YAKINKU?A friend of mine who is Zainachi Korean recently came to town. So where else would I take them? Of course we went straight for YAGYU YAKINKU! Modern Yakinku is the cuisine of the Zainachi Koreans. Many extremely nationalistic Japanese people will deny that Yakinku is the Japanese version of Korean BBQ, but a lot of Japanese-Americans(especially the ones from Hawaii) tend to accept the facts and acknowledge Yakinku as cuisine of the Koreans in Japan. I've known some really die hard conservative Japanese nationals who refuse to acknowledge world history, and even scientific facts. Some of these guys are very stubborn and will deny Yakinku's Korean roots till the day they die. Many people in Japan treat Zainachi Koreans like how some White people treat the Black people here in America. They blame them for all the crime(because 18 of the Major Yakuza bosses in Japan are actually Korean), and most the socioeconomic problems. Conservative Japanese people will practically tell you some kind of bizarre story about how Yakinku originated when a meteor carrying an alien named Jenova crash landed on an Island in the pacific, and the \"god chosen\" residents of this Island(Japan), used their Laser Eyes and Rocket Punch attacks to defeat the aliens. At the end, God was so honored that he came down from the floating continent of Arcadia and presented the Japanese with Yakiniku..Yes, apparently that's how it happened. Personally, I always liked Yakinku way better than Korean BBQ. They use higher quality cuts of meat, which have that beautiful marbling effect. Yakinku is practically presented as a seasoned steak, while Bulgogi tends to be a thin slice of flimsy beef. The kimchi here is actually something called KIM-UCHI. It's a Japanese variation of Kimchi. Kim-uchi was so popular in Japan in the late 1990s that Korean kimchi companies filed a lawsuit against Japanese Kim-uchi companies for stealing their recipes.The thing I always liked the most about Yagyu is their Miso Ramen. I personally believe that Yagyu has the best Miso Ramen in not just LV, but the whole world! I love Sapporo style Miso Ramen, and Yagyu does it better than anyone. Yagyu's Miso Ramen has a very thick, creamy broth which is swimming with natural oils from boiling the pork bones for over a day. The spices are perfect, not too spicy, and not too mild. \u00a0They use an extremely lean and high quality cut of Pork Tenderloin for their charsiu. No other place in LV does that. Even the bamboo shoots are made in-house and are seasoned perfectly. The taste practically explodes in your mouth the moment it touches your tongue. It's the finest bowl of Miso Ramen, period. The only thing that would make it perfect is if they put in at least 1 slice of Naruto. In terms of Miso Ramen, Monta cannot compare. Monta is obviously more of a Tokyo style Ramen house even though they claim they are Kyushu(Kurume). Tokyo Ramen houses specifically specialize in Shoyu ramens. They are practically clueless when it comes to perfecting a bowl of Miso Ramen. Miso Ramen was invented in the city of Sapporo, therefore it's an absolute must to order Miso Ramen from a Sapporo style Ramen house. \u00a0So next time you go to a Sapporo style Ramen house like Ramen Sora, it would be a travesty to order the Shoyu. YAGYU YAKINKU's taste is very similar to a Sapporo style ramen, but the ingredients are so much higher quality. Remember that YAGYU is a very upscale restaurant that only serves the highest quality cuts of meat. For example, Monta uses a low quality belly portion of pork for charsiu and precooks it days in advance. They keep it refrigerated, and don't even warm it up when they put it in your Ramen. That's why at Monta, the charsiu splits and falls apart so easily. \u00a0At YAGYU, the charsiu is a thick lean cut of high quality tenderloin that is seasoned perfectly, then braised. They cut it fresh before they add it to your soup and that's why all the natural juices burst out when you bite in. I am willing to wager that even the pork bones that they use to boil the broth are from a Organic, Vegetable Feed, Anti-Biotic free, Pasture Raised Pig.  The service here has never been less than perfect. Remember that it is still a Japanese restaurant, so you won't get bad service like you sometimes get at Chinese, Filipino, or Korean restaurants. The only 2 times I ever got bad service at a Japanese restaurant was that insane old man at Ichiza, and the degenerate 3rd generation Japanese kids at Santouka in SD.5-stars and one of my Top 10 Favorite LV restaurants.", "Date": "2012-06-02", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Geno T.", "ReviewID": "BKMLDe45DbOveClWNk7n5w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Could eat here everyday if finances let me", "Date": "2013-01-02", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Jackie M.", "ReviewID": "ArSQieejfbxc6cA7qG5i8w", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "f this place! my boyfriend and i walked in, looked at the menu and walked out.they charge 3 dollars for a bowl of rice. wtf?this place is more like korean bbq, not japanese. false advertisement!and the portions would have been really small, had i ordered them.....dont want to pay $40 for a snack for one person. sorry! dont like leaving places hungry.so thats why we left...i hope they close. prime retail space can be used for something else. rip off prices. get them out now.i guess they tried to differ themselves from all the other korean bbq places in lv. fakers.im mean, but i think its bad business. i really do.", "Date": "2009-11-18", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Arthur L.", "ReviewID": "eUJd8tKZ9XuxbHoENp_46w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**Summary** \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Japanese BBQ - They bring you bite-sized raw meats and you cook them at your table. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Quality - The quality of the meats is amazing.

Got no apologies what so ever and food was absolutely mediocre. \u00a0They make menu item in Korean way but refuse to charge the rice or any of the side dishes like a Korean restaurant only because it is suppose to be yakki niku place.... They pretty much charge for everything. But forget about the money. You could be bit of greedy business owner i get that so be it. \u00a0Wairing time and it wasn't busy at all. And non apologetic attitude of servers. Oh btw we saw that the spice bottle has expired 5 months ago and the server just said she recycles it period....

Yagyu Yakiniku in Vegas has this elaborate, instrumented refrigeration system that ensures that the beer is at least 29 degrees. The overall experience of this nearly frozen beer was intriguing. It went well with their house made Kim Chi, ramen and Yakiniku dishes we had. Ice firmed all over the exterior of the glass, and there were glacial flows forming and shifting inside the glass. Interesting experience in that I would have thought hat he beer would yield almost no flavor, but grass and grain could be detected. A normally pedestrian beer made into an experience by how it was served. The food is very good. Both the Miso and he Shoyu ramen is outstanding.
