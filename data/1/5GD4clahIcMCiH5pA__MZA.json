I also normally get the bun tom nuong (vermicelli noodles with grilled shrimp). They give you large pieces of shrimp and shrimp cake pieces as well and it's sooooo good!

Bun Bo Hue is definitely hole in da wall Vietnamese place. I have a sweet spot for this place because I can get all my Hue food and soup at one place. I have cravings for banh bot loc, banh beo and banh nam. The banh beo is da bomb here. The banh bot loc is just decent. I feel like it's been in the fridge and then just microwaved & served to customers. The banh nam is yum, no complaints here. Funny, how the restaurant is called Bun Bo Hue and doesn't have amazing BBH to my standards. The broth isn't as spicy enough. It seems as if it's been degraded down to being more catered to \"Americanized\". The spice level is not up to par to the \"normal\" standards of BBH. However, the Bun Rieu here is very delicious & flavorful. And brownie points for having the shrimp paste!

Although the restaurant is called bun bo hue, do not order the bun bo hue here. It isn't their strong suit. Banh beo is where it's at! \u00a0Banh beo literally translates to water fern cake. It's a steamed little cake with savory goodies on top. Best thing is the pork cracklings they give you (and they're not stingy!) drizzle some nuoc mam and have at it. I could go through a couple dozen of these alone I am sure of it. We did order the bun bo hue (group of us shared) just to try. Broth was not heavy enough to my liking.

I had been stuck in the culinary wasteland known as Alviso for so long that I was literally feeling overwhelmed with choices. So, we wrote down the names of 5 places on small pieces of paper; crumpled them up; stuck them in a hat; and just let the Yelp Gods decide as we picked one. The Yelp Gods apparently deemed it a soup day as we drew B\u00fan B\u00f2 Hu\u00ea (BBH) as our destination. It was actually an appropriate choice seeing as how it was a cloudy and overcast day and I've been hankering to expand my Viet-soup knowledge beyond the normal Ph\u00f4. Plus, any Eastside Viet joint that gets a 4-star average is worth checking out just on those merits alone. \u00a0 \u00a0#1: B\u00e1nh B\u00e8o- BBH has a large variety of appetizers that are apparently very popular with the locals. We opted for the b\u00e1nh b\u00e8o, which is steamed rice cakes topped with dried shrimp. You then top it with a spicy fish sauce and enjoy. I thought it was pretty good,but not great. I will definitely have to try some of their other selection on future visits. 3*#10: B\u00fan b\u00f2 Hu\u00ea:Broth- For the uninitiated, B\u00fan b\u00f2 Hu\u00ea broth is much different than Ph\u00f4 broth in that it's a much more complex balance of spicy, sour, salty and sweet as opposed to the predominant beef flavor you find in the typical Ph\u00f4. The smell of the broth emanating from the bowl was magnificent; I swear it had the subtle aroma of buttery popcorn. Unlike Ph\u00f4, I didn't have to add anything (OK, I did a little bit of Chili Oil but it was completely unnecessary) to it to enhance the flavors. It was perfection. I can't \u00a0remember the last time I slurped up every last drop of broth, but I did here. 5*Noodles- B\u00fan b\u00f2 Hu\u00ea noodles are thicker and more cylindrical than your typical Ph\u00f4 noodles and can be a little harder to manage with the chopsticks for those of us that don't use them everyday. With that being said they were pretty good and BBH is very generous in their servings. 4*Meat- Typically there can be all kinds of \"strange\" meats (e.g., Pig Knuckle, Oxtail, Congealed Pig's Blood, etc.) in B\u00fan b\u00f2 Hu\u00ea, but BBH sticks with only two: Cha lua (aka Vietnamese Bologna) and some kind of fatty brisket. I would've preferred a little variety in my soup, but what they had was fine and plentiful. I really enjoyed the Cha lua; I think I may look into a sandwich next time I get some B\u00e1nh m\u00ec.4*Service and Ambiance- The service is actually slightly better than most Viet-joints as the lady serving us was actually quite friendly and pleasant. The store itself is the classic tiny Hole-in-the-Wall and hold a max of maybe 25 people. Ordinarily I really dig these kinds of places as they usually serve up the best food, but BBH's only downfall is it's location. They're located in the Caribbees Shopping Center and for anyone who's been here knows what I'm talking about when I say navigating the parking lot is a complete nightmare. Service-3.5*/Ambiance-4*/Location-1*BBH is a real diamond in the rough that serves up some mean B\u00fan b\u00f2 Hu\u00ea. If it weren't for the terrible location, I think I could easily see going up to 5-stars, but the shopping center really is that bad. Be that as it may I still highly recommend it, but I suggest you leave your Maserati at home if you know what's good for it.", "Date": "2014-01-25", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Denny L.", "ReviewID": "Y3B4kMy_1Rs2uVodwpdzhQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A pretty good place if you want to get your banh beo craving fixed.

My uncle invited my dad & I out to lunch last minute. I thought we were meeting at my deceased grandmother's cemetary grave, but he decided to eat at this restaurant. I heard this location has been here a long time, but never ate here before. There was a large party of people lingering around outside as we arrived. We didn't see our uncle inside yet. My dad asked those people if they were waiting, and they replied that we can go inside since they were just waiting for a bigger table. Majority of the tables are very small. Even a table of four is crampy. Only one table in the center would fit a large party. Wow, the aroma of mam ruoc just permeates out to the door before we even entered. I didn't want my hair to permeate with the smell of nuoc mam and mam ruoc so I immediately clipped my hair up. LOL. We ordered bun bo hue, cha hue, banh beo, banh bot loc, and banh ram it. The servers brought out our order along with a small bowl of nuoc mam (fish sauce) and crunchy pork skin (chicharron) to share. Since I already had lunch at home, I only ate the little things: banh beo, banh bot loc, and cha hue. The banh beo was good. It had the right consistency of rice flour and dried shrimp ratio, but green onion distribution was hit or miss. Majority of our little plates did not have green onion, oh well, but the dried shrimp is more important. I just like pretty food and a little green here and there would of been a nice contrast presentation to see. The banh bot loc I ate was chewy and not so good because it seemed reheated but not warmed enough. Even my uncle says banh beo is good here. He says the banh bot loc is not too good. The cha hue is just okay. I really want to try the banh ram it. It looked so good, but my dad and uncle ate it all. None left for me. My dad & uncle also ate a small bowl of bun bo hue. It looked very good and authentic! I am assuming the bun bo hue is good or else since my dad is highly critical with food, I would of heard a bad remark during or after him eating the bun bo hue. Surprisingly, none.

My cousin ordered the banh canh, but when it came out, we were really surprised. It looked partially like egg drop soup or porridge.

I say this in all truthfulness because the name of the restaurant isn't what it appears at the physical location. I believe it just has bun bo hue in a banner or something. It is situated in a plaza that's off course in a suburban-ish neighborhood next to a laundromat and a liquor store. I'd say a shady neighborhood but i've seen worse.I came here mostly for the banh beo, an appetizer in the city of Hue (Vietnam) that is supposed to be an homage to all things steamed and served in little dishes. I went inside the supposed restaurant (name on Yelp is different from the actual location but I verified the address and it's correct) and ordered a bunch of little appetizers including the banh beo, banh ram it and the Vietnamese sausages and banh bot loc. I apologize in advance if i've spelled anything wrong. I also had the bun bo hue and the mi quang noodles. The banh beo appetizer was really delicious. I love the idea of appetizers steamed and served in small dishes. The fried shrimp cracker thing was a nice little contrast to the mild steamed rice flour. The dipping sauce (which consisted of sliced jalapenos and fish sauce) was flavorful and the perfect companion.The Vietnamese sausages were unexpected, but it was really nice. They're wrapped in a banana leaf to steam (i believe) and they served it to us minus the leaf. I loved the peppercorns inside.The banh boc lot was really good. I don't remember much of that one but I remember liking it a lot.The banh ram it was my favorite of the few. There is a fried counterpart to it, and it is also steamed with rice flour and has all the yumminess of a banh beo but with a fried bread thing on top. Really delicious and something I will always order. The bun bo hue was nothing special, but it wasn't bad. I still loved the tangy and spicy flavors of the soup. The mi quang noodles were yellow, very yellow. Really good, not spicy, nice tasting in my palette. I remember lots of raw onions that I had to pick out, but it was still hearty and good.And this is the part where many people are concerned with - the cleanliness. This is also the part where I describe how \"down home\" and \"authentic\" this place is. This place is absolutely not for one with a mental appetite, meaning one who eats with their eyes first (even though we all kind of do that....yeah). The place is strikingly not clean looking, the seating is pretty limited and the tables are sticky. The fridge right behind the counter is like a metal meat chamber that the employees go in and out to get stuff. What i noticed is that they do not cover any of their food in plastic wrap, unless they take it take it out inside the fridge? But that would mean they must have a trash bin inside, and we'd all hope to god they don't because that would be even grosser than not having plastic wrap. \u00a0I'm not fond of them mixing raw meats with noodles and other things to steam sharing the same frigid air because that still can promote cross contamination through some airborne way, am I right?

Do not be fooled by the tiny size and kinda look like a hole in the wall lol but the banh beo is delish!

It was different, it was soft and chewy with a crunchy texture on top.. it was new, and it was good! \u00a0Get the cha lua hue along with your banh beo. hmmm. The bun bo hue is not bad.. pretty good. I normally like mi quang.. but its pretty plain there. I wouldn't order it again. But this place is good for all their appetitizer and decent bun bo hue.
