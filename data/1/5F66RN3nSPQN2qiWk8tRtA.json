I need to update my review. Since we started coming here a couple of years ago, things have only gotten better. The quality of the food is very good. The wings are AMAZING: plump and juicy, fresh from the fryer, and coated thick in your favorite sauce or dry-rub. I'm a huge fan of the Dry Memphis Rub: smoky, sweet, and a touch of heat. The wings are always super-hot (temperature-side) when they are brought out to us. The burgers have gotten much better; they are cooked to order and the buns are nicely toasted. And they now have added the option of PRETZEL BUNS to the regular menu. Be still, my carbohydrate-loving heart! They have some great mainstays, like the Tennessee Burger, the Burger Republic, and the Shroomin' Burger. They also have specials a few times a month, so if you get burgers here often, there's always something new to try. The Benton's Bacon Mac & Cheese is phenomenal. We get one cup of it (or two) each time we come in. If you're a beer-lover, this is the place to be. The extra-cold beers on tap have me spoiled. And the bartenders are very friendly. If we ever move away from here, I'm truly gonna miss being a few steps from this place.", "Date": "2014-07-19", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "Valerie M.", "ReviewID": "47RC4iZsoFSb8tm7kVFztQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm a simple girl. Here in the South (and in the universe), I am in the minority of \"low maintenance Babes.\" The down side of this, there is very little room for error, barely a margin for the tiniest mistake. I believe in first impressions, not second chances.So, when I peruse and fully consider the dozen or so burgers you offer, including ones with fried eggs, grilled pineapple, and roasted mushrooms, don't look at me judgmentally and slightly bothered when I order \"a plain burger, well done/no pink, onions and pickles, and monterey jack cheese.\" Furthermore, after just uttering those exact words, I don't want you to (a) ask me how I want my burger cooked (I was in a good mood and refrained from using the word \"still\" when I said \"well done\") or (b) argue with me about my choice of cheese. \"We don't have monterey jack.\" \"Yes, you do.\" (Take it up with the themed burger on the menu which claims to use it.There were plenty of hipster doofi (is that the plural of doofus?) running around the joint, both as wait staff and customers. The good news is my husband's normally blinding, white calves had no competition as the rest of the male clientele's calves were neatly concealed within the confines of skinny jeans.We enjoyed the tater tot fondue appetizer. Would have enjoyed it more with napkins and silverware. I chose the house made potato chips as my side and they were nicely flavored and prepared.The shakes looked good but (a) I'll be hard pressed to justify a $6 milkshake...it's milk and ice cream, for crying out loud. And (b) a milkshake is dessert in my world, not just a beverage.

First impressions are great. The decor was pretty bad ass. Really dig the old bourbon barrels and ammo cans. Place is hopping!! Lots of people in there and everyone thinks they are cool. That always helps the vibe of any place, except a nursery. We order up some beer and some apps. Let's go with... \u00a0The Philly Egg rolls and Hot Wings. \u00a0Egg Rolls are awesome! Love the idea, and great execution. Wings are OK, it's a burger joint, not a wing joint.... \u00a0But I would eat these wings anytime.BURGERS:1. Farm Burger, \u00a0 Decent. Burger over cooked a bit. Bacon too soft to compliment the burger and egg. 2. 4 Cheese Garlic Burger, Over cooked again, but little less than the Farm Burger. TONS of garlic. They nicely layered the garlic into the burger. This is best if you're being stalked by a Vampire. 3. Shroomin Burger, This was my second favorite of the night. Cooked the best of the single patty burgers, and delicious flavor from the mushroom and onion topping. Good ratio of sauce too. Nicely done!4. Classic with Benton's Bacon, Again.... Over cooked. WTF? Turn the heat down or something. This burger showcases the meat. Both cow and pig. Needed a tad more cheese to go up against the extremely smokey Benton's Bacon.5. West Coast Burger, We both agree this is the best burger of the night. Cooked perfectly, everything was in the right proportion. By far the best of the night!!!Overall a good visit to this Burger Bar. Great decor, great service, good food, and local products.

It sounds completely unAmerican, I know. I'm not sure whether burger standards have gone down, or if the quality of meat has gone way down, or perhaps it's a little from column A and a little from column B. Whatever the reason, I have had a pretty blas\u00e9 attitude toward beef. Burger Republic has changed all of that. I have been to BR twice, and both times I have not been disappointed. I have had both the Chili Chili Bang Bang and the Black N' Bleu. The latter was probably the best burger I have had in at least 10 years. This may, in fact, be the perfect burger. If cows knew how good this burger tastes, they would immediately stop chewing grass and resort to cannibalism. I'm sure that BR has other food besides burgers, but honestly...why bother? In addition to having near perfect burgers, they also have a very decent beer selection. Anyone that has Green Flash and Lagunitas is ok in my book.

The sprouts were interesting because they were more or less shredded, which struck me as sorta odd, but tasted great nonetheless! The gf got the farm burger with the ham, egg, pepper relish, onion, tom, etc and it was def the highlight......other friend got the chili burger, which I didn't try, but he was perfectly content with.

They have a great variety of pretty inventive concoctions both non-alcoholic milkshakes and then spiked. I wanted to try the Reese's and the Irish, but they were out of both. Apparently they make their flavored infused vodka's in-house and they had run out. Oh well, the nutella one it was, and it was delicious! Couldn't really taste the alcohol, and it most definitely didn't give me any sort of buzz, so I wish they had kicked it up a notch in that dept. So thrilled by the milkshake, I was stoked for our entrees. However, the burger, to me, was good, not that great. I went with the Burger Republic burger which was smoked gouda, Benton's bacon (points for that), grilled onions, lettuce, tomato,. Excellent bun, juicy burger- a tad thick, but cooked nicely. It was almost too juicy (aka too much fat in meat) that it just saturated the brioche bun. Don't get me wrong it was very delicious, but I still think the Pharmacy has a superior burger. The truffle tots were a bit overpowering to me- the regular tots tasted better. The tots were nothing fancy, just regular old tater tots. My husband had the farm burger, which he enjoyed. We also tried the Benton's bacon mac & cheese. I am definitely a mac & cheese snob. This was one was a white mac & cheese, not very cheesy (needed more of a sharp cheddar) and it was very milky/runny. It would have been great had it been baked and congealed more. The topping was good, that is where the bacon and crumbly topping came in. Tasty, but not mind-blowing. My kids wouldn't touch it. I would rate this in the top 5 burgers in Nashville. I think Pharmacy and Fido come before this place. Definitely a good spot, family friendly. The prices were reasonable, and they also had a great beer selection.

After 4 visits, it's just not getting any better and the excuse of \"It's a new restaurant and they're finding their groove\" is just NOT valid anymore. Let's talk about our beef with this place, both bad and very good!1. It's tough to find a good burger these days. Most often, when the server asks me how I want it cooked, I feel like it doesn't matter what I say because it'll get done how it gets done. At BR, Medium, truly means juicy! Lighter in the middle but you still get the good char on the outside. At BR, you get what you ask for.2. Variety. Simply put, the idea of a \"gourmet burger\" is always phenomenal. Seriously, it never DOESN'T sound good! With creations like the Holiday Burger (a turkey patty served up with a cranberry glaze and brie cheese), or their Taco Truck Burger (by far the best Mexican twist ever between two buns), all the way down to a good 'ol Shroom Burger with plump, mushrooms grilled to perfection, the menu continues to \"moo-ve\" in the right direction!3. Authenticity and Representation (aka: Vibe): Nashville isn't short on restaurants and certainly has it's fair share of establishments boasting burger elegance, best beef, food in a pharmacy, or the idea that 5 is somehow the magic number in the burger kingdom. I'm fine with any place having it's schtick but there's something inspiring about the fistful of burger and the authentic, nerdy, attention to detail BR puts forth with every creation. I enter the place thinking about the food, not the mood, which to some, factors in differently, but I say more power to 'em!4. It ain't just about finding the beef either. BR has an insane selection of hand crafted shakes and their drink selection is out of this world. On point again and proof that the nerds had it right to begin with!5. Lastly, the food doesn't just appear on the plate in front of you. Someone has to bring it out and unfortunately, BR doesn't come out on top with their service. I am no expert in the Food Service industry but I do know people, and I've even got a place reserved for me in the Awkward Hall of Fame. That's why I can spot someone who's out of their element a mile away. The servers at BR just seem...off. It's not that their not friendly per-say, rather just awkward. I know that reading people is hard but sheesh people! You work at BURGER REPUBLIC! You should be jacked about the chance to serve this stuff. Nothing, I repeat, nothing on your menu is lame. *End rant*In the Burger Republic, the people have spoken. It's no dictatorship here. That's why this burger joint is the best in Nashville. Period.

I haven't been on a Middle Tennessee burger tour or anything, but this was the best hamburger I've had in a long time. I also got a side of the horseradish aioli. This place has good milkshakes, but they could put that horseradish sauce in a cup with a straw and I'd drink it.My wife had the Burger Repulic, which she said was tasty too. It comes with a 'Republic Sauce', that added a kick. The fries...... :-/So, we concluded our meals with 2 milkshakes. Wifey got the s'mores and I opted for the salty caramel. Shakes are on par with the burgers. Delicious. My only problem is on my next visit trying not to order the same thing.

You'll see a take on this at many places around town and typically it includes just about every topping you can imagine. In this case we are talking about smoked gouda, fried egg, and bacon. It's quite a formidable burger because lets be real here people, everything is better when you put an egg on it.Another interesting item and probably my favorite on the menu is the PB&J Sliders. You might have heard of these as the Elvis burger made famous by the king himself and his proclivity to peanut butter, bacon, and banana sandwiches. \u00a0You won't find any bananas here but the rest of the ingredients are present - \u00a0angus beef, peanut butter, and Benton's bacon jam. It's pretty hard to go wrong with anything that includes Alan Benton's bacon and this is one of the more interesting uses I've seen with it. All I can say is that these sliders are delectable. Other things worth mentioning - beers are half price beers before 6pm. There is an impressive microbrew selection both in bottle and 14 or so on tap all of which can be enjoyed outside on the \"Patty-O\". \u00a0The taps are rotating so you'll never know for sure what they have but it's always a diverse list including some high gravity beers since obtaining their liquor license. \u00a0Now that football is in full swing they are featuring the Titans games on Sundays.

Tony and I decided to try something new to satisfy our Burger Need..and you know how I like NEW restaurants and trying New Foods.

I asked for a minute and Tony gave me a strange look...\"What are you doing?\"..I turned over the menu and pointed to all the different interesting names for the micro brewery beers and he shook his head...\"NO..why fix something if its not broken\" and besides I never like them...so what do you think he ordered...Yep that's right BUDWEISER in a bottle...I pointed out 2 or 3 that sounded really good from the descriptions but could not turn his head..he is loyal to Budweiser...you got to love that!!! I ordered the Unsweetened tea with lemon and lime..I would have loved to try a few of the micro brews but I can't handle beer anymore, so I only get to dream of it...lol !!! \u00a0 \u00a0 While Jake was gathering our drink order, we were reading the menu..One of the things we noticed and like immediately..the choices are NOT THAT LARGE...too many decisions can cause issues many times...Quoted by the Great Chef Ramsey..so we like when a menu is simple and offering some really interesting choices..I couldn't decide between three different burgers...1. Chil Chili Bang Bang, 2. Buy the Farm and 3. The Taco Truck...so I had to play \"eeny meany mine-ee mow!\" to make my decision. The winner was the Taco Truck with French fries and Tony opted to choose \"The Fenway\" with a side of Tator Tots. So we were happy with our selections. \u00a0 \u00a0Jake brought the food order rather quickly after the drink order, the service here was friendly and fast...and with the customers lining out the door to be seated, we could understand WHY!!!  \u00a0 \u00a0 Once the food arrived, I took my photos and then began dividing up the food. Tony took half of mine and I took half of his..that's the way we do it and we enjoy trying our foods this way..Tony's Fenway was 100% Angus Beef mixed with Spicy Italian Sausage and seasoning and then topped with grilled onions and peppers with cheese and a Brioche bun..It was very good!!! So juice and grilled to Medium (pink in the middle) perfection. If I could change one thing I would have added a smokey BBQ sauce with a bit of heat to give it that sweet and tangy taste..but truthfully it was very good.  \u00a0 \u00a0 These burgers looked wonderful So full and tall showing all the toppings and something you would notice on a TV Commercial...they were very EYE CANDY PLEASING!!!! The Taco Truck burger was topped with Pepper Jack Cheese, Jalapenos, Sour Cream, Guacamole, lettuce and tomatoes...and OMG..it was so good!! Right from the first bite...It was like eating a TACO..it was amazing and in fact MY FAVORITE of the two..Now even though both were good and the TACO TRUCK my favorite thus far..when I go back I will definitely try one of the other two burgers that I wanted but had to forfeit. I have to admit, Neither of these were the BEST Burgers I have ever eaten, but they are worthy of a 2 thumbs up and IF you are in the LENOX VILLAGE AREA and want to try a great restaurant with Above Average Burgers...GO TO BURGER REPUBLIC !!!!

Let's begin.So I actually found this place because we felt like getting a Nutella shake specifically, so searching Yelp for that yielded this place, which also happened to have amazing burgers. I had the Chili Chili Bang Bang, while my date had the Black N' Bleu. We just cut them both down the middle and shared, since they were both so good and we wanted to try as much as possible. The Chili Chili Bang Bang was a solid mix of (Sam Adams?) chili and monterey jack cheese and onions, with the burger cooked medium rare right below it all. Honestly, it was quite a mess, but SO good. Meanwhile, the Black N' Bleu was pretty clean, with blue cheese crumbles (obviously) but also cajun spice and onions. I honestly liked the black and blue burger more, but I really want to try the Fenway next time. As for the side, Tater-tots, so crunchy! Haven't had tater tots since middle school, but these were crunchy and delicious. I am a little sad they don't have sweet potato fries though.For drinks/dessert, we had shakes - the Spiked Nutella and the also a spiked Velvet Cake shake whose exact name I don't remember. They were both freakin delicious man, so smooth and cold yet not soft or melted. I preferred the velvet cake one, just because it had little pieces of cake that conveniently were sized to fit perfectly through the straw. Meanwhille, the nutella shake was just delicious because.... well it's nutella, its just always delicious. The consistency was great too though, just like the other one. Not too strong on the alcohol though, so I wouldn't order this mainly as a drink, I just like the kick.Overall, I loved the place and I'm probably on my way there again right now....", "Date": "2012-10-17", "Author_Location": "Dallas, TX"}, {"Author": "Bridget S.", "ReviewID": "Dv5hOznUdbxf2rLDZZ8anQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great for lunch...a bit pricey, yet great burgers!", "Date": "2012-09-30", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "John B.", "ReviewID": "XthvapfBzEeGjTBoSAIxcw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best burger I've had....in Nashville for sure.

My wife ordered the The Classic - American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion, Pickle Chips, Toasted Brioche Bun 8.95 and stated it was one of the best burgers she has ever had,..while i ordered the \u00a0 The Burger Republic- Vermont Aged White Cheddar, Guinness Braised Bacon and Onions, Lettuce, Tomato, Republic Sauce, Brioche Bun 9.95 ....which was decent at best. Kinda lacked in flavor if you ask me. \u00a0Wifey's burger was not cooked well done like she asked but it didn't take long for them to rectify it and she was quiet pleased on how the new burger still had its flavor. The few tv's they had were cool, and the manager turned on the NBA finals for me, so customer service is on point!The Badd: \u00a0Not much to say bad wise, ummm I'm used to a more sports bar feel where you can hear the sound of whatever game your watching while the music is still playing. I did ask the waiter if it was possible to turn up the sound for the NBA finals but she informed me they didn't have that option and regretfully apologized. It was all good though! In conclusion: I will return for the wings, and even though I strayed from my favorite spot, Burger Republic still lacks in the really cool atmosphere, multiple TVs, pool table,dart board, and great staff the \"Other Place sports bar always offer.", "Date": "2012-06-18", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "Gabe L.", "ReviewID": "slAmGfCrWOfe_CQkelTcbg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The burgers are really good and creative.

I get it sometime places run out of things. then they brought out my burger and my husbands was going to be \"right out\" once I was halfway done with my burger the server brought out my husbands fries and no burger. I was shocked. then when I was done with my meal and another couple minutes goes by and the server brought out the burger. by this time my husband's fries were cold. the server didnt appear phased and by this time we had to leave because we had our young child with us but to say th eleast it was not the way we wanted to spend a special occasion.
