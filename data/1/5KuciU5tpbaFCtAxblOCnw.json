So while they may not offer the best service and are overpriced, sometimes you have to bite the bullet.I visited here twice during my stay, both times only using the counter service. The first time was late night for dessert. It took about 20 minutes for them to box up 2 pieces of cake and deliver them from the kitchen. That seems a little excessive to me. Good thing they quickly made me a tasty decaf mocha to sip on while waiting.The second time for breakfast. It is nice to have healthy options, so I indulged in a fresh made juice and a breakfast sandwich. Juice was good (I would hope so for $9!) and the sandwich was just ok as it was warmed in the microwave. We waited again about 20 minutes for the juice and the sandwich.On a previous stay, we have had sit down service. The food was pretty good, nothing stellar. I will be back because it is the only place to grab and go with decent food any time of the day you are ready to nosh without wanting to leave the hotel.", "Date": "2014-07-18", "Author_Location": "Carlsbad, CA"}, {"Author": "Jane A.", "ReviewID": "-oXa4yb4rjYM2fWL2jHKqQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was bad. We had a dining credit due to our room at The Hotel being booked up so we tried it and it did not work out. This is the Mandalay Bay's answer to a 24/7 restaurant. We tried to go here twice. The first time was around midnight. The place was empty and I asked for another table so my sweetheart and I could sit side by side. There were probably 40 tables available. The hostess told me in an extra snotty manner that they are a 24 hour restaurant so they will need the four top table for another party. My sweetheart was offended by how she addressed me and suggested we leave immediately which we did. I should not have returned. The second time we returned I tried a side of mac and cheese and the French onion soup. The soup was meh. The mac and cheese was cold as if they didn't microwave it long enough. It was definitely microwaved. They were out of carrot cake. It was super super expensive- around $30 for one person. It was really really loud and hard to talk. Don't go here at all. There is no reason to.

Management is horrible. This place never takes their customers seriously. Now I know why many people left bad review toward horrible/rude customer service and managers. When the good service comes along with the good food, then it makes the restaurant good.Menu: I think this place has good selections from sandwiches to good soup menus.But I have no idea how the taste are because I had to return the food. I bet the overall quality and taste decent by reading other people's reviews.Price: Pretty high as a quick bite casual place. Of course, this is in Vegas. But Wynn has much better casual restaurants with the same price level.Service: If you are planning to order something over the counter, don't expect to get treated nicely. Just think you are at the local $3 burger shop, but the price is 5 times higher. First, the cashier / hostess at the counter, is not professional (I don't think they are rude. It seems like they just didn't get trained enough about how to serve customers politely).The worst part is the manager, who is even worse. This place's manager (Mike) is the RUDEST manager I have ever met in my life. I saw another bad review about this place's manger, now I know why. if you have any issue with this place, don't even try to make it fixed with a manager, cuz it will make you look like you are the one with the problem.

I want to first say that our server was amazing and tried his best to give us the best service ever. Thank you!! My friend and I were hungry after a late night on the town, we were staying at MB and were craving burgers. We got there and were seated right away. My friend ordered the French Dip Steak and it was horrible! The meat was dryer than the Las Vegas heat, no taste! The soup that came with it was bland and the pasta was disgusting. Meanwhile I had the hamburger that had no taste to it. Now usually if we were paying a cheap price, you get what you pay for. But these orders were $20 bucks a piece. And I understand that it's late at night, but either lower the price or give us fresh food. We let our server know that we didn't like our food (we couldn't even finish it) and didn't want anything else. Then the manager came and basically told us that they did ask us if we wanted anything else and \"apologized\". Yeah, whatever dude. At the end of it all we did get a cut off our total, but the whole experience was a total let down. If you're going to be serving food, all I ask is for it to be GOOD.

My husband has the patience of a saint and saw that they were extremely understaffed but why the hell does it take the manager 15 minutes to make one espresso? The poor dude who ordered the espresso just seemed amazed at the whole process too, but you can't badger someone who's touching your food, ya know?

Picture lots of men on steroids with tons of testosterone, pent up rage and Affliction t-shirts. \u00a0HAFood: 1 Turkey Sandwich, 2 Iced Teas and Chicken Soup= $66.00I was craving some comfort food to help revitalize my energy levels. I had a giant sandwich on my mind, so I walked through the Casino in hopes of eating at the Red, White and Blue Restaurant. I come to find out that my favorite sandwich spot is closed and Citizen's Kitchen & Bar has replaced my go-to sandwich spot. Citizens prides itself on non fancy, REAL comfort food. The vibe is new American mixed with old fashioned comfort. \u00a0The environment was great, the service and food..not so much. When we arrived for lunch, there was one other group at the bar. We were told by our server that we were the first lunch customers EVER. Since we were the first lunch customers, I didn't come with ridiculously high standards. I was here with the most relaxed group of foodies. I grew up in a restaurant, so I'm always pretty calm and understanding when things go wrong, however there were so many mistakes and unkept promises, I was embarrassed for the restaurant. Charles Barkley showed up 1 hour after us and still got served before us. Haha \u00a0It took us 2 hours to get a cup of chicken noodle soup and a hot turkey sandwich. We were told 6 times that our food would be out soon. The hot turkey sandwich with gravy was COLD. One turkey sandwich, one cup of soup and 2 iced teas cost us $66.00, no joke. The manager did not listen to us and acted as if we were an inconvenience. \u00a0We didn't get a discount, but they offered us free pastries. We \u00a0were not interested. We won't be coming back here. Tip of the day: You are better off going to Subway or a food court for lunch. \u00a0Take your $66.00 to STK, getting a mouthwatering steak + the mac and cheese and enjoy ridiculously superb service.", "Date": "2013-02-04", "Author_Location": "Seal Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Matt L.", "ReviewID": "qHesOxylc1IVBMkaNCWvKQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Stopped in to grab breakfast in this place since it was in the Mandalay where we were staying and it was pretty good.

I was meeting a girlfriend at the bar for some drinks after a long workweek and we settled on Citizens because neither of us had been. The restaurant was pretty much empty save for the bartop, which was close to being full. Next to us were a group of what looked like A/V or production guys that were just out from a gig at the House of Blues. With no seats, my friend and I posted up at the bar, and were quickly provided bar stools by two observant servers. The bartender was nice but it was hard to get a hold of her when we needed the check. I am usually a fan of Light Group venues for the most part, but this one just didn't quite seem to hit the mark. It seems like it could be something really great, but maybe it was just too much hype too soon?", "Date": "2013-03-23", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Aya D.", "ReviewID": "VRXHJMp7mNmzCftzpWkyow", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Husband and I went there for brunch I ordered the benedict with salmon and my husband got the chicken and waffles.

It took a long while to get our food, but we didn't want to make a big deal because the Olympian Soccer player, Mia Hamm was sitting right next to us. I ordered the Mac and Cheese which the cheese was so runny, it looked like clam chowder. The cheese wasn't orange, but it was white. I also had the Smothered Tator Tots which was good. My fiance had the Tuna Melt and Corn on the Cob, He enjoyed the corn, but said he had better Tuna Melts. After we got our food, we noticed the waitress so involved with Mia Hamm and her guest. We finally made eye contact and asked for our bill. When I gave her my credit card, the waitress came back with my reciepts to be signed. I was writing a tip and calculating my total when the waitress came back. She apologized and said she accidentally put Mia Hamm's table on my credit card. She said, since they didn't close the bill, my credit card will not be charged. WRONG! I went on my bank statement that day and I seen two charges for Citizen's.

The space is huge, and comprised of all hard surfaces; hard floors, hard ceilings, and hard walls. What this equates to is an extremely loud dining experience, even if it's not that full. The vaulted ceilings, light fixtures and finishes are all cool, but this place is just huge. I would also point out that if you want comfort, do not sit on the incorrectly proportioned backless bar chairs at the bar, and instead get yourself a table. \u00a0More importantly this place is overpriced; you'll notice that just about everything on the menu is about $2-3 more than you'd be willing to spend. I had this gripe when I ate at Mandalay's noodle shop a few weeks ago when my lunch special was an astonishing $18 for a soup and lunch-portioned dish. Apparently the property really likes to take advantage of their massive convention crowds. With everything from breakfasts, salads, burgers, entrees and desserts you can certainly find something you'd like, just expect to pay handsomely for it. Also, they use the words 'specialty' and 'signature' quite a bit on their menu, but looking around at other people's dishes and based on my meal this definition seems to be based around providing mediocre, high priced sandwiches.My classic hamburger was placed in front of me and looked as mediocre as it tasted. The bun was dry and a bit too big, but well-proportioned to the patty. Not sure if you have a choice of cheeses, but when I asked for a cheeseburger I wasn't offered any options and was given American cheese. The presumably frozen patty had ok char flavor, but was of your extremely generic back yard BBQ variety, and very overcooked at that. But I guess one of this quality shouldn't be ordered any other way. One small slice of not too fresh tomato didn't provide much coverage, but I had plenty of pickles, lettuce and red onion at my disposal. Overall this had nothing great going on. My waffle fries sucked as they always do, and considering the menu gives you the option of skinny fries, potato salad or coleslaw I'm not quite sure why I got these stupid fries. They're clearly never fresh due to how they're made, so why bother? Plus, $21 for a burger and iced tea is about $9 more than you should pay for this, even in a casino setting capitalizing on desperate conventioneers. After this awful experience, combined with Burger Bar's drop off, I can probably now claim that there are no decent burger options south of Tropicana along the Strip until you get much more south away from the casinos. If you're at Mandalay I would still recommend Burger Bar over this as you get far better quality for the money, but I can't promise anything there anymore.", "Date": "2013-07-19", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Angela A.", "ReviewID": "NKtJIOF2RxtVDZQNHNRdtA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We were heading to Starbucks but decided to check Citizens out for coffee since it was something new.

Unfortunately the execution was inexcusably poor, especially for a \"signature\" dish. The chicken was flavorless and dry, even with the skin left on. Broccoli rabe was undercooked and also flavorless, and the potato quarters were the least cooked of all, with a full half of them too hard to even cut with a fork, and inedible. Everything sat in a plate full of broth, perhaps that's in an attempt to disguize the dryness and blandless of the food, but even the broth doesn't help. Chow in San Francisco does this chicken/brussel sprouts/mashed potato dish that's just bursting with flavor and juiciness, and it's like 12 bucks. This $25 plate was just sad and pointless.

The bar with its uncomfortable foo foo hard plastic bar stools is always loud due to its hard tile surfaces. The service is unpredictable depending on who is working at the bar. The take out can be a good option but it's take it as it is. Pre made and don,t ask for it any other way. Once again young no personality who gives a shit attitude. Even Burger King will give it to you your way if you ask at a fraction of the price. They are open all the time which is a plus since I often finish working late.", "Date": "2013-11-16", "Author_Location": "Escondido, CA"}, {"Author": "Ava T.", "ReviewID": "riXotLTXsHBU_3C_9EfsTQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Fast, friendly service but mediocre breakfast items.

Greasy hash browns, gross pancakes that tasted like they forgot to mix the bisquick batter and the most bitter cup of coffee I've ever had. All for the low price of $25, what a joke. Also I could not get the waitresses attention and she didn't come back to my table for 20 minutes. When I told her I almost did a spit take when I tasted the coffee. She took the cup and came back 10 minutes later with the same bitter brew. If you want bad food and bad service this is the place for you.

The to-go counter saved me with their kale salad, it was fresh and delicious. Too much dressing - really wish they could have the salads w/dressing on the side or ease up! But yummy anyway. Also nabbed the crudite veggies and tossed the ranch dressing. Pricey, but I was happy for some fresh veggies!The sit-down side got me through breakfast with a tasty CA omelette. I got the eggs fried (and requested them cooked in butter not oil) with avocado, sour cream and pico de gallo on top. A little pile of tatertot hash came with. Was it mind blowing? No. Was it tasty, fresh and satisfying? You bet. The hash was \"meh\" but I could see folks liking it for that salty kick back to grade school. Coffee (iced americano w/soy) was quite good. Service was attentive and friendly, no complaints. All in all I am grateful this place is here and will gladly come back knowing I can get a fresh tasty meal. Expensive? No more so than the rest of Vegas.Thanks, Citizens! (I'd actually give them 3.5 stars, 4 if the menu were a little more inspired, but all in all the food is reliable, good, and fresh.)", "Date": "2013-06-24", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Mike D.", "ReviewID": "BYBSxf5SPxM8ZkK5ScGD0g", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "overpriced and over hyped.", "Date": "2013-05-10", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "John B.", "ReviewID": "VFt5WU2oHnM1xz0NL5zv_A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would have given this place 3 stars but the service was horrible.

They don't tell you that the people working the counter have no idea what is going on and you could probably finish two meals sitting while you wait in that ridiculous line. We opted for the line though b/c we didn't know. There were like 10 employees working behind this counter and they could barely pour a cup of coffee. Three of them were working on one person's order b/c she must have had a comp meal or something but really there were at least 20 people in line while we listened to this. Once we made it to order, I just got the yogurt b/c I knew the wait for eggs might take until lunch. My friends got the banana pancakes and eggs benedict. The pancakes were huge, doughy and honestly just gross. There was nothing redeeming about them. The eggs benedict was okay but nothing too great. I highly recommend the breakfast at Raffles as a good alternative in Mandalay Bay.
