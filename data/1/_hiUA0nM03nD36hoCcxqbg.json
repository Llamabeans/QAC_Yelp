Also, in back, they have all-natural products that range from soap to essential oils and everything in between. This place is serene and calm and perfect.

We waited at the counter for several minutes before being acknowledged, despite 3-5 people working behind the counter at 3:30 in the afternoon. My Gal Pal ordered first and after taking her order the man was nowhere to be found and I stood there for another couple minutes before being asked if I was ready. (Note, I was standing there with cash in my hand right behind her in line the entire time). Gal Pal ordered: \u00a0- Half avocado sandwich and a cup of soup.- The ACME juice (Carrot, beet, apple, ginger) I ordered: - \u00a0The 1/2 Doozie salad - The Lean Mean Green Machine juice \u00a0(Cucumber, kale, celery, parsley) The place was pretty empty and quiet, again 3:30pm. We sat at a table and after about 10 minutes my juice came out. The glass must have been freshly out of the dishwasher (good, I guess) but that meant I was drinking a lukewarm juice out of a HOT glass. Pretty gross. Maybe I just can't keep up with the hipsters, but I felt like I was drinking a warm glass of grass. Another 10 minutes goes by and our food finally comes out. Again, soup/salad/sandwhich at off-peak hours taking 20 minutes? Wth? Gal Pal kindly reminds the Server Man she never received her juice at all. Server Man blames it on the Juice Guy. Once delivered, Juice Guy blames it on the Server Man. Whatever. Gal Pal also points out her avocado sandwich is actually what appears to be a Tuna Sandwich. Server Man corrects her and says it is actually a Turkey Sandwich. OK.....? She just requests an avocado on the side because at this point we're OVER this place. She sips on her overly gingered juice that tastes like soap.PROS: - The hummus that came with my salad was delicious. - At my next hipster party I can say I once drank a warm $6 juice cause I'm so healthy.", "Date": "2014-03-13", "Author_Location": "Minneapolis, MN"}, {"Author": "Jessica S.", "ReviewID": "woVBJYRDuC1xqhNtZYAegQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love me some good-for-you food.

Luckily for me, Tao was able to provide both of these. This was my second Tao experience. Last time, I got the sweet potato burrito, which was delicious. This time, driven by hunger and slight work-induced delirium, scanned the menu for the first thing I saw that sounded good. The end result was a tasty black bean burger with a mixed green salad. The beauty of Tao's food (at least from my two experiences) is that it is delicious but does not leave you feeling sluggish or guilty. When I finished my burger, I was the perfect amount of full and felt healthy and energized.In addition to my love of the food, I am also a big fan of the atmosphere. This place has good vibes all around, from the employees to the other customers. While sitting by myself eating dinner at a restaurant for the first time (the lyrics to that song \"I go out and I sit down at a table set for two...\" repeating in my head), I had some nice interactions with some friendly people around me.

On one hand, I love the food every time I go (which is important). But on the other hand, I have had a less than stellar experience nearly every time I've gone to Tao over the last three years (which is pretty often... I just keep going back for the food!). Most of the staff is pretty friendly, but the service is always really slow and unorganized. I've seen a handful of customers get really angry that their meal has taken over 20-30 minutes to get to their table, or that their order was switched with someone else's that arrived after them. As other reviewers have noted, sometimes the staff fails to even acknowledge you as a customer at the counter, or they seem annoyed to take your order. It makes for a really uncomfortable and awkward dining experience at times. One time we were even given attitude for coming into the place 10 minutes before they closed and ordering 2 smoothies. HELLO- you are still open so I have a right to order something! (let alone a smoothie, which should take all of 1 minute to make). The pros: The food is tasty and fresh, and there are a variety of gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, etc. options on the menu, including specials that are offered each day. If you have a serious allergy/intolerance, though, I would caution you because cross-contamination may occur. I especially like the sweet potato burrito/bowl, the Doozie, the Royale, and the GF waffles on the weekends. The smoothies and juices are good too, they just take forever to make. Also, the store attached is really great and has MUCH better service than the cafe. The staff is knowledgeable, experienced, friendly, and excited to help and to explain their many different natural products. And they even have a discount on the first Saturday of every month!

Knowing I may not have time for dinner, I ordered this $12 dish with plans to save half for later. The plate comes with steamed veggies, black beans, avocado, sauerkraut, and flax oil with brown rice. I was much looking forward to the veggies, but they were pretty plain. Almost like frozen veggies. Surprisingly, the sauerkraut was one of my favorite elements. And the avocado, of course. If I were to return I would definitely try the sweet potato burrito. Two people in my group ordered it and were quite satisfied. The smoothies also intrigued me but at $6+ I couldn't convince myself.

I counted and found 16 instances on the menu where it says \"avocado\" or \"guacamole.\" Niiiiiiice.I ordered the black bean burger (added cheese), which is enormous and comes with a side salad. The burger is topped with tomato, lettuce and house guacamole (spread thickly on BOTH sides). It was good, but ask for a side of hot sauce if you want it to be great. Even the hot sauce seemed homemade---so tasty that I'll probably ask for that no matter what I order in the future! Fair warning that this meal is difficult to eat because the burger is quite soft. I ended up just forgetting the bun and eating it with a fork so that I didn't fill up on bread or end up with half the burger in my lap. Win-win.If fresh juice is your thing, they have what looks to me like a very well-appointed juice bar. Most of the juices and smoothies are over $6, which is cost prohibitive for me.

Add avocado to a sandwich? $2.50. Extra bread? $2.50. Before you know it, your $8 meal turns out to be $13 or more with these add-ons and you leave still feeling hungry.Also, they got rid of their vegan waffle (why???) and their veggie burger is not vegan either (it has cheese in it). What a disappointment. At least they added the black bean burger, which makes up for the loss of the cheese-filled veggie burger. Also, their macrobiotic rice plates pack more of a kick than you might guess, especially with toasted sesame oil.All that said, Tao has great atmosphere.

I could see where someone may have ordered it thinking it would be sweet and then find out they were wrong---but that isn't at all the case with this particular friend of mine. She knew what was in the juice and that it wouldn't be sweet. That wasn't the problem, but the staff operating the register wouldn't hear it and made comments to the gist of 'you obviously don't understand because you don't know what organic juice tastes like, you idiot' in not quite so many words. The intent was very clear through the tone. I was pretty amazed by how rude they were.

I had the tempeh reuben with one of the juice blends, she had the black bean burger with a shot of wheat grass.

After that I'd recommend the sweet potato burrito, the black bean burger, or the quasadilla. These are a tad more affordable at around $8-$10.
