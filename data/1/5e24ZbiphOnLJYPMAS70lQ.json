The pizza is so delicious, the location and parking are great, and the owner and employees are very nice. Can't wait to go back!This pizza might be my favorite in LA, and my boyfriend and fellow pizza-lover from Boston agrees. The crust is perfectly fluffy and chewy, with great sauce and cheese and the best pepperoni I've ever had. We got 10 inch pizzas but will get the larger size next time we come. Pretty good value too considering how delicious the pizzas are! We also got gelato, which was pretty tasty as well.The interior is very cool--a big open room with benches, so plenty of space for larger groups of people. You order in the front by a more private smaller room, and then the pizza ovens are at the back of the big room. Also, there's a parking lot! A big one!The owner walked around and seemed genuinely interested in how everyone was enjoying their meals. The girl up front taking orders explained all the pizzas and gelatos to us nicely, and the pizzas came promptly after we ordered them.Once they get their liquor license, DeSanos will be the perfect place for parties and group gatherings with delicious pizza, ample seating and parking, and a friendly owner and staff with fast service.

I can skip over any of the usual \"best-of-breed\" neapolitan places, which have in common the chewy, blistered thing that DeSano has, but also are so frequently over-wet. I'm so sick of that. If Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be that, then the VPN bureaucrats have to rethink. Yeah, this is not a crispy thing, and it shows just why it doesn't need to be.

We ordered their namesake DeSano pizza (sausage and pepperoni). Amazing. Maybe the best I've ever had. Really. It's like they took the best sausage, the best pepperoni, and the best cheese they could find on the planet and put it on the best dough that they could possibly create.

You order at a register, then seat yourself in a giant room with picnic-style wooden tables, with TVs mounted on one end, and a diligent crew of pizza chefs at the other, slinging dough and firing up pies in cute brick-colored ovens. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful, and the pizzas are charred up to order. Prices are great (between $10 and $15 for a 10-in. pie, $15 and $22 for an 18-in.), and if you'll believe it, there is a free parking lot that is never full. If DeSano were in Silver Lake, it would be mobbed every night, and people would pay the $5 for valet. As it is now, the crowd is more neighborhood families than hipsters and yuppies. \u00a0I've gone twice in the last month, and I expect to make DeSano a regular stop for casual meals. The place is comfortable, cute, and spacious enough that it doesn't seem to get crowded. The service is notably friendly for this kind of restaurant, and on our first visit, a very Italian man who must be some kind of manager or owner went around the tables chatting with customers.The food is serious, on par with the offerings at much fancier wood-fired pizza restaurants around L.A. The menu consists mostly of pizzas, with some calzones if you prefer your goodies on the inside. The pizza is fantastic, with a thin, charred crust that's \u00a0alternately chewy and crispy, the kind of crust you don't want to leave on your plate. There are red and white pies, and so far, I've stuck to red. The base red pie uses a hearty San Marzano tomato sauce, some lovely buffalo mozzarella, and a touch of garlic. The Margherita D.O.P. is a must for purists, a quality pie that uses great, simple ingredients. The Capricciosa is another classic pizza, topped with mushroom, artichoke, and prosciutto. The artichokes are particularly nice. The titular DeSano is a good one for meat lover's, with nothing but sausage and pepperoni on the red pie base. I'd also recommend the Lasagna pizza. It is not, (un?)forunately, layers and layers of pizza. It is, though, an interesting pie topped with meatball, pecorino romano, and soft splotches of ricotta in addition to the mozzarella. My favorite pizza at DeSano, though, is the San Gennaro. It's topped with caramelized onions, zesty Italian sausage, and chunks of peppadew, these hot, flavorful marinated pickled peppers that get juicy and blistered in the oven.If you want more than just pizza and calzones, DeSano offers a couple salads and, sometimes, an antipasto platter. (This is a complete accounting of the menu, by the way--DeSano is really all about the pizza.) Both salads are great, and they cost $6.50 and $7 for sizable portions. The spinach comes with mozzarella, onions, cranberries, mushroom, and artichoke, and it's very good except for the raw mushroom. The caprese is delicious, with spinach, mozzarella, cherry tomato, and basil. There is probably less mozz than there should be, not for the price, maybe, but for the leaf-to-cheese ratio. Still, tasty. Both salads come with balsamic vinegar. For dessert, you can get cannoli, biscotti, or gelato, of which I have only tried the gelato. It's really good. I'm not sure where it comes from or why it's so great, but it is top notch stuff, flavorful with an ideal creamy texture. I like the classic pistachio and hazelnut, but if you want a light coda to a big pizza meal, the tart, refreshing lemon sorbet might be more your speed.DeSano is working on their liquor license, so unfortunately, you can't have beef of wine with your pizza just yet.

Plus there is Italian cable TV!The buffalo cheese is the best I've had in this country. So what's lacking, why not all the stars? In short, the personnel. They try hard, but are not artists like the chef/owner of Mother Dough, down the street. \u00a0The owner/manager here arrived after we did, so in fairness, I would bet the pizza improved later this Monday evening.I read the other reviews before writing this one, and they're all accurate -- but I especially identified with one who said, \"Why do they dump these beautiful pizzas on a cold aluminum tray?\" They do not arrive piping hot. \u00a0The CENTRAL question though: \u00a0Is this a Pizza vera di Napoli? No, it isn't. Why? \u00a0First the ovens weren't hot enough, no rip roaring fires, so the pizzas get a bit hard and dry before coming out. One oven was nearly okay, the other not, so two pizza margharitas came out to our party very different one bubbly and fairly moist, the other card board-liike. Both too stiff. \u00a0The Marinara pizza was very good and moist, but lacking oil.This is almost pizza di Napoli...but balances on the danger of losing its identity through chefs who aren't trained enough and tend to make what they grew up with...American pizza (but with better ingredients). The only way to assure good pizza makers is for the owner/manager to make all the pizzas, or somehow really.train the cooks, send them to Naples, so they know how its supposed to taste.Many great pizzerias have ultimately failed here, such as Anitica Pizzeria, a million dollar restaurant out of Naples, started great...the workers though, aside from a handful, reverted to making dry tasty, but plain pizzas. In short, all the money, ingredients and fine ovens can't make a great pizza...only men and women trained well and extensively in the ART of pizza making. I wish I could like this place more. I've lived for 30 years practically next door. I will try again and report back.

Hollyweird...The 900 degree wood burning ovens are named after saints, all 40000 pounds of them. \u00a0There are sacks of San Telice flour and large cans of San Marzano tomatoes stacked high in front of the food preparation area which is part of the dining area as there is a transparency to how they prepare the pizzas. \u00a0They bring them out on parchment lined jelly roll pans so never mind asking where are the plates. \u00a0Pizzas come in either a 12\" personal size or a larger 18\" pie meant for sharing. \u00a0They don't do half-and-half pizzas, we asked...You order and pay up front and then go around the corner and squat one of the communal tables. \u00a0There are two tv's to pass the time which isn't too much at all considering the layout. \u00a0In addition to pizzas, they also have calzones and salads, and I hear that they even have sandwiches. \u00a0 BYOB; \u00a0they don't currently have any corkage fee...I had to order the standard DOP Margherita, the mozzarella di bufala Campana just melts and spreads evenly across a thin layer over the crust of exacting proportions and rise to be called a true Neapolitan. \u00a0They use crushed cherry tomatoes from San Marzano, the pomodori, and carefully lay out fresh leaves of basil to form a cross in the middle, an artistic touch of the pizzaioli. \u00a0The crust is slightly blistered from its 50 second exposure in the 900 degree oven just as it should be. \u00a0The dope is that it's a thin crusted but chewy pizza where you can taste and realize the texture of each component, the colors of which represent the Italian flag...The Capricciosa is a mushroom, artichoke, prosciutto pizza again with the artisan buffalo mozzarella. \u00a0The ingredients are fresh and laid out evenly and deliberately with the right balance, you can really taste the artichoke hearts as they are not washed out or overwhelmed by the meat, the same could be said of the mushrooms...We decided to try the in-house cannoli and gelato offerings. \u00a0Cocco Cioccolati is a chocolate on chocolate cannoli sprinkled with chocolate chips and confectioners sugar. \u00a0I wasn't sure how to approach the first bite and the tube shaped shell cracked length-wise as I awkwardly picked it up to my mouth. \u00a0There was a ton of filling, more than I am used to seeing which made it even harder to handle and the taste of the chocolate was a little strange for a ricotta, not what I was expecting. \u00a0I was more amiable to the lemon flavored Gelato which was tart, and tangy, and refreshing...On a side note, we ran into a nice couple that we met during DineLA and renewed our acquaintance; \u00a0they had already been here 5 times by then and everyone at DeSano's treated them with the same familiarity and celebrity like Cheer's. \u00a0But that's also the way the service seems to be here: \u00a0cheerful and friendly -- plus the employees love to ham it up and photobomb anytime they have a chance... =) After such a disappointing outing recently at Bollini's, we were very happy to have found out about this place to satisfy our pizza craving. \u00a0I would put these guys right up there with Settebello's and Fuoco's when comparing Neapolitan pizzas. \u00a0I know we'll be back again...", "Date": "2014-02-21", "Author_Location": "Covina, CA"}, {"Author": "Richard R.", "ReviewID": "NL3pXYVwbRFRUvNTOMuUVw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wow!

I don't eat red meat so I picked off the meatball pieces.. not a problem since there wasn't a lot of them.Note: They do NOT have a liquor license and it is not BYO....

The gelato was fantastic.

I don't care how fancy the toppings are or how specialty the pies are supposed to be they are not that tasty. The pizza is a touch overpriced especially for the average taste of it. The place is perennially empty and the hard ass wooden seats make for zero comfort. Yea you can watch your pizza get made but it's usually barren in there that half the staff watches you watch the pizza and then they watch you eat it. You can't make substitutions with orders probably not to confuse the staff but you can take off a topping. A suggestions was made that you should be able to enter the shop off of Santa Monica instead of entering the intrusive and county like chain-link fence that barricades the place, giving it a closed off vibe. The dining area is huge but it looks like an empty warehouse with wooden tables and ovens.

I really wanted this place to work. I'm a self proclaimed pizza aficionado born and raised on proper NY pies, and have a pretty strong handle on the LA pizza scene after living here for 16 years. The space is huge. Could be fantastic, but seems cheaply done. Much like the food, the potential is there, however, the execution just doesn't meet any expectations. Pizza coming from a wood fire oven should be crisp, charred and hot. Flavors should burst from the cheese and sauce like a marriage of two perfect ideas. Instead, what we found was completely flavorless sauce, tasteless cheese and an undercooked crust that didn't have any bite. You want fancy pants pizza, skip this and make your way to Mozza. It's the real deal. This felt like it was made by a less particular. You want serious NY style pizza, try Garage, Vito's, Village, or Bravissimo in Santa Monica.", "Date": "2014-03-02", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}], "RestaurantInfo": {"RestaurantID": "5e24ZbiphOnLJYPMAS70lQ", "Name": "DeSano Pizza Bakery", "Price": "$$", "RestaurantURL": "/biz/desano-pizza-bakery-los-angeles", "Longitude": " -118.2977494999999", "Address": "4959 Santa Monica BlvdLos Angeles, CA 90029", "Latitude": " 34.090845600000002", "ImgURL": "//s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2TWLKbs6pIXlabpkZP2oBA/90s.jpg"}}
