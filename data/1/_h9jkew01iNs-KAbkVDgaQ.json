I am always in the loop, and the farthest I've ever gone is to Puzzles on the other side of Skinker. Actually, one of my good friends started working here and I was interested in trying it. So lo and behold, one of my close friends came back home from her study abroad and wanted to meet me up for some dinner and I suggested we both try Tavolo V! I felt super bad because I was late getting here first, and thennnn I had trouble finding it, but I am a little blind so I didn't realize it was right in front of me after I drove around a bit. My boyfriend had to point it out to me...haha. Oops! So finally getting in, we were sat down, and our server was very kind and gave us time to look at the menu (and for me to munch on the complimentary bread, olive oil, and parmesan! Nom nom nom!!) \u00a0My friend had ordered some bruschetta and I'm normally not a fan of tomatoes, but yum! It was very good. My boyfriend and I weren't really sure of what to eat, so we ended up ordering a pizza. I wasn't entirely starving, so I thought sharing would be better. Lame, I know, but maybe next time, some pasta! We picked the Babbo's pizza which had sausage, caramelized onions, balsamic vinegar, fresh oregano, and mozzarella cheese. I've been craving artichokes lately, and when I saw that some of the other pizzas had artichoke hearts as a topping, I was hoping that my server would allow us to add on some artichoke hearts on it. Thankfully the Babbo's pizza had a few toppings because he let us and I was ecstatic! \u00a0 When our food came out I was so surprised! It was such a large pizza, I was thankful that I was sharing with my boyfriend, I definitely(!!!) could not have eaten all that myself. It was amazing. I can't even begin to explain it! I wish I had more of it cuz I was in love. It was a thin crust pizza (my favorite) and everything was perfect to me. To top it off, the bill was about $13 with tax (before the tip) and I only wish I didn't get to order more.

We started with the bruschetta appetizer ($5), which was good, but could have been more flavorful. The del Pietro salad ($6, iceberg, romaine, Parmesan, red onion, tomato with a vinaigrette dressing) was good, but nothing to write home about. The Babbo's pizza (tomato sauce, sausage, mozzarella, caramelized onions for $12) however, did live up to the hype -- crust was thin and crispy, sauce tasted fresh, and they drizzled some balsamic vinegar over the top. Delicious. We opted for a bottle of the Toscolo Chianti ($26), which was fine. They don't have many full bottles under the $35 price point, but the Chianti was a nice option. Our service was excellent, and the space is really cool -- modern feel, brick walls, and they have garage doors on the front that they can open up on nice nights. Pros: good pizza, great service, cool atmosphereCons: The menu is a little limited -- not much besides pizza and pasta", "Date": "2014-05-31", "Author_Location": "Saint Louis, MO"}, {"Author": "Diane M.", "ReviewID": "VL7rhoqFloZv5Va3UGcckQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I came here on a beautiful Friday night with a group of seven. Though they don't take reservations, we were seated within 20 minutes which was surprisingly quick considering how packed the restaurant was. Loved the openness of the space and dim lighting - the inside seating area is not completely enclosed, so there was a nice breeze blowing from the outdoor patio. Service was amazing - we were promptly greeted by the server after we sat down, and he was very attentive and helpful throughout the course of our meal. As for the food, the majority of my friends ordered the Tutto Mare pasta, which they all loved. I got the Funghi pasta which was amazing. It was creamy, fragrant, and seasoned very well. The bread that they served was also warm and amazing.

At 6:00pm on a weeknight we were immediately seated but the restaurant filled up quickly around us. Decor: Big(ish) open space with gorgeous exposed brick and high ceilings. I love places who consider their spaces and make the best of it. Big and small tables for all group sizes. Food: Modern takes on classic and authentic Italian dishes. Thankfully inventive since Americanized Italian can quickly feel boring. My dining companion and I ordered the Tavolo V pizza, the Alfredo Pasta with Chicken, and a special appetizer with shrimp and polenta. Dining companion loved her pizza. I thought my Alfredo was a little under seasoned but the pasta was cooked perfectly. The star of the show was the shrimp polenta appetizer. Put that baby on the regular menu and I will be here all the time. I'm even trying to replicate it in my own kitchen (and failing), so please serve it again.

When you dine out as much as I do, you forget small details about your earlier meals. I forgot how they present their Calamari, here at Tavolo V and didn't request my spicy tomato sauce to be served on the side. I do not always dip my Calamari, I like it plain with just a squeeze of lemon.Our last visit we did not enjoy any of their amazing salads, but this time we enjoyed two of their most popular. My dining partner ordered the Beet Salad. It had a HUGE Fried Goat Cheese ball in the center of Frisee, which was surrounded by cubes of red and golden beets. It was all tossed with a white wine vinaigrette, which added a simple burst of flavor. My salad was the Del Pietro, a simple house salad that could rival those at Rich & Charlie's. I'm not a fan of Iceberg lettuce, but Tavolo V mixes it with Romaine, Parmigiano Cheese, red onion, tomato and then tosses it with a house vinaigrette. A glass of wine, with their fresh bread would make this salad a perfect lunch. Seeing their Lasagna being served to the table next to us on our last visit, my dining partner knew what he wanted. The portion is so huge, two adults could actually share it as an entree. \u00a0It is a mixture of beef and pork with ricotta and parmigiano cheeses in a rich thick tomato sauce. He could only eat half of it and enjoyed the remainder the next day for lunch. Our server commented, he has never seen anyone eat it all in one sitting. For my pasta dish, I enjoyed the Pomodoro. It was a spaghetti dish with olive oil, garlic, diced fresh tomatoes, basil and goat cheese. I am a goat cheese addict, so this was the perfect entree for me. I found this dish to be light and refreshing for a pasta entree. I've always had excellent customer service here and look forward to my next visit. Before ordering next time, I will be sure to reread my reviews so I know to order the Brussels Sprouts and the Spaghetti with Meatballs.

They have great food all around and it's an awesome space. It's a very open \"raw\" space. It has a pretty cool bar, too. I would love to come here and eat at the bar sometime! Anyways, onto the food.I've been to Tavolo V twice so far and each time I got a pizza? What's wrong with me??I think Tavolo V has helped me figure out that I really dig fancy pizza. I'M NOT BORING. I PROMISE. The first time I got the \"Pazzo's\" and it comes with \"Olive oil, shrimp, pancetta, mozzarella and goat cheese.\" I am huge fan of pancetta and shrimp so I had to try it. While it was delicious, it was a little too salty for me. But yes, I did eat the whole thing.Pizza round 2 was the \"Babbo's\" and it comes with \"Tomato sauce, sausage, caramelized onions, fresh oregano, and mozzarella cheese,\" This pie was super good. While the sausage and caramelized onions were delicious, what really made this was the unlisted balsamic vinegar they put on top. This pizza was the perfect combination of flavors and I highly recommend it. I also tried some of their appetizers. They are a little pricey for how much you get but are still packed with flavor. The ravioli and zucchini were great but their best was the calamari. Oh myyyy laawwwwwdd. The spicy tomato sauce they put on top of these puppies has so much flavor. \u00a0I used to think tomato sauce was boring and predictable but this stuff was magic.I hope to be back and explore some other dishes....or more pizzas.", "Date": "2014-01-06", "Author_Location": "Saint Louis, MO"}, {"Author": "Aaron P.", "ReviewID": "_k08Hx0-qNO2KkeAfxFOhA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The food here is decent but boy is it pricey.I came here for lunch with a couple of friends and did not mean to drop $20, on pasta and a beer but I did so thats that.

Oh and that other Italian place down the street in Clayton can cry because they wouldn't accommodate our group without a $750 food and beverage minimum so our business went elsewhere, to a place that takes reservations, loves groups and split checks happily. Soapbox rant over. Tavolo V deserves your full attention! I chose this place for ISC because I had bookmarked it as a \"to try\" restaurant and I noticed that all of my Yelp friends rated it highly. Usually I try to vet places before I bring ISC to them but I felt fairly confident that we'd like the food based on friends' reviews. They get bonus points for having their own parking lot in a long line of street parking only eateries in the Loop. We were a group of 13 and service was flawless all night. We had one waitress, Ryan, and she took great care of us throughout. She gave a lot of recommendations and helped us make decisions along the way. There was another large group (probably double the size of ours) that was there before us and it didn't affect our service at all. I started with the roasted cauliflower, which received accolades in reviews. It was a pretty big plate! I should've shared it with someone but I did manage to eat it all. It had orange and purple cauliflower along with the traditional white. I prefer a little color to my cauliflower and so I enjoyed these varieties. They were flavored and cooked perfectly. I managed to snag a bite of the special soup of the day, cauliflower soup. It was delicious. I would order it in the future. They brought fresh bread to our table along with separate bowls of Parmesan cheese and olive oil. Perfect combination. I wavered on what to order for my entree and decided on the alfredo pasta. It usually comes with chicken and spinach but I got it with just spinach. It was THE BEST alfredo pasta I've had in memory. Usually it's heavy and can be fairly bland but this was so flavorful and the pasta was perfectly cooked. I loved it. My husband got calamari, and they accommodated him with giving him a larger portion than the appetizer size so he could have it as his entree. He said it was really good, some of the best he's had. I got to steal a bite of tiramisu for dessert. I've never thought I was a fan... but I was this time! Save room for dessert - I will next time. Everything about this night was awesome.

I recalled reading an article about Tavolo's opening about a year ago, perhaps that is why the name stuck with me. It is owned by the same owners of Sugo's and Babbo, which boded well for quality right off the bat.Drinks were a good place to start. Since I was already breaking out of my comfort zone, I decided to go with the Blood and Sand, a martini featuring Oban 14-year-old scotch, vermouth, and orange juice, along with another ingredient that I can't recall. The drink was not sickly sweet, in spite of this lineup of ingredients, but I don't think whiskey purists would go for it. One drink was definitely enough, to savor and take the edge off, and I appreciated the inventiveness of the drinks menu. The salads are crisp and fresh though HUGE and probably worth splitting if you are ordering a main course. The pizzas were inventive and I went with an artichoke, lemon, and basil special. I am a sucker for artichokes, and would have demolished more had I not filled up on the salad beforehand. I wished that I could have packed up the rest; maybe Tavolo should think about keeping 'to go' boxes ready for customers who are headed to a show at the Pageant, to pick up after the performance. Just a suggestion.The d\u00e9cor had a clear European vibe, including \u00a0a roll-up garage door setup leading to the outside, which featured additional seating, all the better to people watch. The interior, with its rough hewn walls and exposed ceiling was also in keeping with the restaurant's rustic Italian character. There was no problem being seated, but that would have been a different story if we'd come in even a half-hour later.

Unlike other places with outdoor seating, the flow between indoor and outdoor felt natural due to the garage-like doors that could be pulled open. I could feel both the warm breeze and chilly AC from where I was sitting. Not great for the electricity bill but definitely great for my happiness!We started off with the funghi and calamari appetizers. The mushrooms were tasty and the baby arugula made is nice and bright. I thought there was a tad more oil than I would like in the dish and I wanted more varieties of mushrooms. It was good though. As for the calamari, delicious. Lightly battered rings of squid sat on top of delicious tomato sauce. I loved how they even gave us the tentacles. I really enjoy eating calamari with tentacles. :P We then got some salad (good but not amazing) and some bruschetta. The bread was firm but good and the tomatoes on top were flavorful. There were real slivers of basil and that made the entire dish perfect for me. As for an entre, the bf's dad and I got the risotto of the day (crab and shrimp with asparagus), my bf got the lasagna, and the boyfriend's dad's wife got the cannelloni. I enjoyed my risotto but it was a bit more brothy than I'm used to. I thought the crab flavor could be a tiny bit stronger. The asparagus was perfect. I had some leftovers, so I took it with me and ate it for lunch the next day. Wow. It was so good when I reheated it, I gobbled it all up. My guess was that it was good but I was just too stuffed on appetizers to realize it the night before. As for the lasagna, I had a bite and really enjoyed it. My bf loved it and dug in with so much gusto. He had some leftover too -- which is a pretty good indication of how much food we had. The cannelloni looked really tasty and the bf's dad and dad's wife were trying to identify the filling. I think they decided it was spinach and ricotta. They were pretty blown away by the flavors.

All of this by itself would have kept me coming back for more, but let me tell you about the food!Everything was absolutely excellent. Cold foods served extremely cold and hot foods served extra hot. Each dish was a perfect blend of ingredients and flavor. The bruschetta is an excellent appetizer or salad choice. I ordered the clam chowder, which was a special for the night. I was reluctant to order it because I'm not really a fan of clams or seafood, but the way the waiter described it made it irresistible. It was AMAZING. It was garnished beautifully when it came to the table, piping hot and full of flavor, and to my surprise the clams were tender and juicy, not dry and chewy like I've had before. My dad got the chicken alfredo, which was simple yet very delicious. His girlfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs. The \"meatballs\" are actually like 2 big baseballs on top of spaghetti. That was also an excellent, classic dish. For dessert, we were offered a free piece of tiramisu for my birthday. I had to accept even though I was full because I knew it was going to be good. Tiramisu is always my dessert of choice, and this was the best I've ever had. It was served unusually cold, and this seemed to make it 20x better than anything else I've had.

The mussels and the cauliflower were excellent, the calimari needs some work, but was not terrible, just ok. In terms of the mains, I has the mushroom pizza, its Neopolitan style, very thin crush and the cheese and wild mushrooms were super yummy. In our group the pork chop was large and very moist and everyone seemed to enjoy the evening. The lassagna was this large brick of goodness.

Their menu is very decently priced unless you get a special...mine was $25 but my boyfriend's lasagna was only $12. My wine was $9 and it was one of the lower priced options.

So, I think the reviews are so mixed on this place because it really depends on what you're looking for. This is updated, lighter Italian, and very vegetable based, which for me is perfect, especially in the summer. I honestly don't like old school St. Louis style Italian (I'm from New York) and there is no way I really want to eat lasagna in June, so Tavolo V turned out to be a perfect choice last Saturday.The interior is cool, very rustic industrial. They don't take reservations, and the place was bustling, but we were seated in about 15 minutes on a Saturday evening at 7:30. So, perfect. Our server was... fine, nice... but sort of... rough. Haha. I don't know how to describe it. For example, I don't ask for a lot of fuss with my wine service, but the way he slammed open the bottle, splashed the entire thing into four glasses, and then whisked it away had us laughing. It didn't really bother me though. Overall, the service was good down to the little things, like empty plates removed promptly, etc.The food... I really liked it. For appetizers, we ordered the bruschetta (perfect,) the tomato salad of the day (delicious,) and the spinach pancake, which was interesting and had a homemade vibe I like, but was also rather dense and heavy, and could have used some sort of sauce or accompaniment, in my open. I had a really hard time deciding what to order for an entree, but opted to try a pizza since my boyfriend was getting a pasta. I tried the Mars, because I wanted something with artichoke hearts, and it was delicious. Again, I think this depends on the style you like. This pizza is thin, wood fired, light on sauce, delightfully crispy/chewy, and I love that. I preferred it to The Good Pie. Compared with Pi, it's simply different, that's all. I love a lot of different sorts of pizzas. The pastas I tried were also good. Very simple, highlighting the vegetables, with light broths for sauces. Nice, but could be a bit boring for some. I was more impressed with the apps, salads, entrees, and pizzas, but I will try more pastas if (when) I go back. Now... the reason Tavolo almost lost a star, then earned it back. Our appetizers came out promptly, but the entrees took far too long. We were chatting with another couple, enjoying our wine, so it honestly wasn't a huge deal, and we didn't complain or anything, but the wait was becoming excessive. However, when our food arrived, we were told that our bill was being discounted by 50% because of our wait time. Even when we said that wasn't necessary, our check arrived with the 50% discount... on everything. Everything. Not just the late items, or just the food. Our drinks, wine, appetizers, and entrees were all discounted. I was truly impressed. Good job Tavolo for recognizing a problem BEFORE a customer complaint and making it more than right.

We only walked away with one pizza togo box and one tiny little pasta togo box. Everyone scarfed everything down! We got the cannelloni, the Alfredo, pomodoro, lasagna, a seafood entree and 2 other dishes. All came out beautiful and all went down the hatch with delight. The wine and beer list was good. I would have maybe liked 1 or 2 more house wine options that didn't cost $8-10. All of the cheaper wines ($7) were sweet wines. There are a few brewers in my family and they can be snobs about what they drink. They had no issues finding a drink to their liking and then ordering a second. The service was great. Our bread (so yummy!!!) and drinks came out immediately. The salads were soon to follow and I was impressed with the pasta and pizza delivery.
