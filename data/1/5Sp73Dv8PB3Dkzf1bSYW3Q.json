I was visiting my mom and stepdad and Three Flames was recommended to them from a friend. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants (I'm hoping for obvious reasons) so I was enthused to try this independent place. Booking a reservation by phone was easy and convenient. My folks are in there 70's and 80's, so they don't get around quickly. From the moment we arrived, we were treated with patience and kindness. We were seated immediately and I believe Renee was our waitress. Service was prompt, friendly and courteous. Her knowledge of the menu and ability to make recommendations was extraordinary. Where can you order scalloni these days? My prime rib was delicious too. My stepdad loves to tell cornball jokes and Renee not only put up with them but laughed at them too. :) The prices are dynamite for what you get, especially in the Bay Area. I can't give them 5 stars simply because I don't think they are trying to be a 5 star restaurant, and that's O.K. They are very good at what they do.I look forward to dining here again and recommend you give it a try too if you're looking for a good meal at a reasonable price.I almost forgot... the artichoke mashed potatoes were the bomb!", "Date": "2014-06-27", "Author_Location": "Roseville, CA"}, {"Author": "Liana H.", "ReviewID": "qzU4sMhyj4BceaE4CxEWtQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been here two years in a row now for their Easter Buffet. I don't celebrate Easter, so I hang out with the Catholics who like to have a good ole feast for the holiday. The brunch buffet is pretty dang good, I must say. For 28.99 you get the vast brunch buffet, as well as AYCD champagne, mimosas, coffee and tea. Sodas and anything else from the bar is extra. \u00a0Once you party has arrived, you are seated at your table, drink orders are taken and then off you go to the buffet. Here were my favorites: Blintz, \u00a0Deviled eggs, Bruschetta, Pasta Salad, Eggs Benedict, and French Toast. They also have different cuts of beef, crab legs, smoked salmon, shrimp, loads of breakfast foods like pancakes, eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage as well as every type of deli salad you could imagine. You really get your money's worth at this buffet. I wish that they had labels of what the dish was because some are a bit hard to identify.

I WAS SEVERELY DISRESPECTED BY THE OWNER CHRISTINA AND WAS TOLD THAT MY FAMILY HAD COMMUNICATION ISSUES. I WAS ALSO OVERCHARGED 50.00 AND THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO NOT REFUND ME. \u00a0THE STORY IS BELOW. 1. My husband and I were overcharged an amount of 50.00. \u00a0We signed off on a receipt that was 40.05. Two staff members had communicated that the gratuity was already included. When we looked at our statement, we were charged 90.05. My husband called and was told by the manager Christina that the gratuity was not included in the bill, and the EXTRA fifty dollars was the gratuity. If so, communicate correctly with your employees because they are giving out false information and IF fifty extra dollars was the gratuity, why didn't the receipt reflect that? We sure as heck didn't give a 50.00 dollar tip for that cold and tasteless food. 2. I called to get the fully story and was told a different story than my husband. The owner Christina told me that my family, did not put in enough paper money and that was why my card was charged an extra 50.00. When I said that signing off on a 40.05 dollar receipt when I was charged 90.05 in actuality \u00a0was unethical and poor communication and wrong, the owner Christina said, \"I think your family has communication issues.\" And hung up.

When you go in, one of the first things you see is an antique cash register with buttons that I'm unsure how to describe. The lights are dimmed to a modest glow, and you can choose to sit at a booth against the wall or a table. The clientele tends to be more mature than I am, and the prices are meant for a higher income bracket. The closest thing I can compare to Three Flames would be Black Angus, except Three Flames is a step up and has a wine menu. \u00a0I glanced at the regular menu, but my gaze quickly focused on the dinner specials (and their prices thankfully cap at $25). I can't really say that I've had any of the dishes they were offering, so I just picked the most expensive thing on the menu: the New York Strip Steak with Shallots and Merlot sauce. I ordered my steak rare, and just ate the bread that was provided as I waited. The server gave me my choice of salad or soup, and I chose the Cream of Cauliflower soup. It had pieces of actual cauliflower in it, so I could tell it was the real thing and made fresh. Then came the main course. I got a baked potato, and sauteed broccoli in a cheese sauce with my steak. I am not accustomed to this type of American food since the closest thing I've ever had was Black Angus and maybe Red Lobster, but my steak was very good, and it edges out the competition purely based on taste. It was juicy and the color was spot on for rare steak. I enjoyed all the items on my plate.Should you come to Three Flames? Is it worth it considering you could get the same type of food at other cheaper American eateries? Hmm, I think it's worth it if you're looking for a nice quiet place to enjoy your evening, like if you're celebrating a birthday or anniversary. For myself, I came here because my mom purchased a certificate on Restaurant.com, and I thought \"why not? If I don't like it, I'll just write it on my Yelp review later.\" But I enjoyed it; the food is definitely delicious and the ambiance is relaxing (for people who like the quiet).

(altho.. his songbook seems to have just about everything.. and some of the most lushly-orchestrated karaoke cuts of Frank Sinatra songs I've encountered anywhere) The Three Flames has a good sound system, a great dance floor, and lots and lots of regulars (mostly mid-life and up) who love a little old fashion slow dancing. It's kind of neat to see them enjoying themselves the way they do on the dance floor. Crooner renditions of old standbys like \"After the Loving\" and things tending more country western are appreciated and danced to.Tips for Connie's show: In addition to her regular songbook.. be sure and check out her much bigger binder labeled \"More\" this lists all her songs in CAVs Super CDG format.Suggested song selection criteria.. play to the crowd the first part of the evening with some slow-danceable songs.. then for your last round.. experiment with her Motown selections..

Meeting the parents for dinner and this was their choice. The young girl who greeted us was terrible. No smile upon entering the lobby, not genuine. I felt like we were a major inconvenience. Very condescending about our seating, offering us a booth in a tone as if we were a group of children. I don't know if she was riding the express train to Bitchville that night or if she is just rude all of the time. If I wasn't with my parents, her attitude alone would have made me leave. She was NOT warm or welcoming, and she didn't even try to fake it. We were also asked four times if a booth would be ok in this really weird manner that made me wonder if the booth seating there was some sort of major insult or something. The whole thing about the booth was really weird. The booth was fine, by the way. So it makes the questioning even more puzzling.On a side note, yes, this is the place where seniors dine. I don't think they let you eat there unless you are with someone over the age of 60. Seriously. Not that there's anything wrong with this, but it was kinda funny. I am guessing these people have been dining here since day one.The part in the dinner menu made me giggle: All entrees come with a vegetable and a starch.I don't think food has been referred to in that manner since the 70's, and I am guessing they never bothered to change that part of the menu since the restaurant opened decades ago.The food is your typical american fare. Steaks, chicken, starches (potatoes). You get a basket of warmed bread before dinner, which wasn't bad but I was really hungry. I ordered grilled chicken. I had the minestrone soup and it was very salty. The chicken was ok but salty, grilled veggies had a lot of lemon. I liked my garlic mashed potatoes (my \"starch\" choice - hahaha). My dad's steak wasn't done the way he asked. My husband didn't like his calamari. My mom said her meal was ok, but this was her way of saying it was underwhelming.I wish they didn't salt the heck out of everything. All the old people with hypertension are being done a tremendous disservice by being fed such salty fare. And I felt kinda icky after the meal because of it. The table service was quick and thorough. This was probably the better part of the experience.As we left, the rude girl at the front forced a goodbye, but still no smile.", "Date": "2010-05-09", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Vivian B.", "ReviewID": "BblvTS9598kIL7qCKPNxzA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took my boyfriend there for his birthday and they were awesome!

But the hostess was welcoming and greeted/seated us right away with our menus. While looking over the menu we were able to observe the restaurant and noticed there was only one waitress taking care of the whole restaurant with the help of a busboy. Also, they had a private room where they had a live band playing. I guess this area is for diners to enjoy once they were finished with their meal.Our waitress came and took our order. I ordered the prime rib and my fiance ordered the new york steak. Once our order was placed my fiance googled Three Flames and found out that they have been owned and operated with the same family for over 30 years. Just a little fact for you reviewers. It was nice to know that Three Flames was a nice family owned steak house. Overall our dishes were a-ok. My prime rib had good flavor but was overcooked yet raw near the bone.

So in the end, it was more like drinking ranch dressing than eating salad. I asked for the filet mignon to be cooked medium, as well. I expected to get something a little more on the rare side, (it is a cut of beef after all), but ended up getting an overcooked, under-seasoned piece of meat that I could've made and screwed up at home. Supposedly they had some sort of private party in the other room at the same time, which made the service extremely slow. It took 20 minutes for the salad to arrive, and an additional 30 minutes for our entrees. Other personal gripes included this guy sitting at another table who wouldn't stop staring at us.

They claim to be a Steak house so you think they would know how to prepare a good steak... I ordered the rib-eye with with the salad. Considering the price the salad was a standard for a road house, a handful of bagged lettuce with some overly dried grated carrot and a slice to tomato on top. Luckily I asked for the dressing on the side, others at my table ended up with a small amount of salad swimming in a heap of dressing. The steak was one of the worst bits of meat I have ever had in my life. I ordered Medium Rare and I am really firm on this. I ended up with an over done bit of soggy steamed meat. You may wonder why I use the world soggy? Well they cover the plates similar to that of room service in hotels. My guess is my steak had been sitting under the warming lights steaming and cooking away for a good 15 minutes before it reached our table. I guess these beaten up cheap covers are supposed to give the place an over all feel of fine dining... it doesn't help.The waiter I know look at the meat and knew I wasn't happy. I asked him what were the chances that if they re-fire it would come back better... he just shook his head. He also mentioned it would most likely take another 30+ minutes for a refire. Since we waited almost an hour for this meal I didn't think it was worth waiting another half hour for steamy over cooked meat.

Veal Special W/ Mashed Potatoes and Sauteed Vegetables (Carrots, Onions, and Zucchini):The veal was not special one bit. It was drenched with a sauce that looked and tasted like hollandaise. The veal claimed to be tender, but the meat felt very chewy and stiff, almost like I was eating sliced beef that is used in vegetable sautes. Don't they know that veal is very lean?! They surely overcooked it, if I had known, I would have requested them to cook it medium-rare. Since the dish costed $18, I figured they would know what to do. I only ate one piece and finished my mashed potatoes, which were made chunky, and the perfectly cooked vegetables. The side dishes had more flavor and tasted significantly better.Tiramisu:Moist and not too sweet. Pretty decent. It needs more of a liquor kick to it though.Peach Cobbler W/ a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream:The waitress asked us if we wanted the cobbler warmed up, so I am not sure if that meant the cobbler was sitting in the fridge or on standby in the kitchen at room temperature. Nonetheless, the dough tasted very rich and buttery, probably more than it should because I think they microwaved the cobbler so the butter got a chance to soak back into the dough. It's a heavy dessert, especially if you're eating a late dinner. Patrons: Primarily elderly folks. Very nice atmosphere though and no one stares at you when you walk to your table.

They brought precisely what we ordered, were attentive without being intrusive, and let us sit for more than 3.5 hrs in total, includ. dinner.Having said that: The \"sing-a-long\" (server said it is not karaoke) with Sally's piano-playing was a bit much. \u00a0Sally did a good job on the piano, but the volume of this from the bar was pretty overwhelming. It reminded us of going to the bar in the National Hotel in Jackson, CA in the 70s & 80s. Choice of songs: Great. Execution: Well, they were having a very good time in there. Volume: Overwhelming...I had the Flames Fish Grill (18.95), which could not have been better: salmon, tilapia, prawns. Even the \"mixed vegetables\" [usu. a joke in places like this] were not overcooked & really were fresh, mixed vegetables. \u00a0Starter salad or soup & large baked potatoes were properly cooked, potato not 'waved, very large, were included. Another in our party had a steak, of which we received no complaints; the third ordered baby beef liver (14.95) with bacon & grilled onions (yeah, I know...), said it tasted just like the same dish at the Winchester Flames, in other words, as you would expect such a dish to taste ... \u00a0Well, the bakery items sounded good, but we bypassed the tiramisu (& glad we did after reading the review above). \u00a0The bakery items at Flames, Winchester are out in a case, first thing you see when you walk in the door -- & servings are huge. \u00a0Again, said not to be connected with 3 Flames.
