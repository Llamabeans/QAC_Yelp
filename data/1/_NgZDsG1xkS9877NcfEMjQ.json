I love the queso all the time but tonight I could not enjoy it because it came out at the same time as the food. I asked for my wings extra crispy and they weren't crispy at all!

I am a brewniversity member with approx 165 beers, I have spent a lot of money at taco macs but this fails to meet all expectations. After last night I have decided that if I want taco Mac I'll just go to Decatur where I get great service. Walked into the metropolis location just after the USA soccer game ended and it was packed but people were started the clear out by the masses. We put our name on the list for a 4 top. They said 50 minutes but with so many people leaving it was bound to be shorter than that. We walked up to bar and got a beer with in ten minutes of being \u00a0there 3/4 of the restaurant was empty with dirty tables. After 15 minutes half of the tables had been cleaned. I then walked up to the host stand to see where we were at in line as doing so I noticed a couple of servers just siting at various tables doing nothing. Got to the host stand they said we were 5th in line. I waited another 10 minutes with 3/4 of the restaurant emptied and cleared and still not sat I was pissed and myself and the group had had enough. We decided to cut our losses and give our business to the vortex which was awesome. The whole time this was going on I didn't see a manager at all. I have dined in this location many times and the service is always slow and horrendous. They never have updated daily beer lists the only time you ever see the management staff is when you walk by the office to go to the bathroom. If you are looking for a slow moving service this is your place. Judging by some of the recent reviews it seems that people have been experiencing similar experiences as mine. Looks like management is doing nothing to change this.Think twice before visiting this Taco Mac!", "Date": "2014-06-23", "Author_Location": "Canton, GA"}, {"Author": "Kelsi V.", "ReviewID": "SDgTo3NVBG9LVj9sTaNIwQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Food is okay at best.

I feel bad giving 2, and it's really not 3. It's really 2.5 but like the math on the check here, I have to round up.Ok people seem kind of confused about the parking validation thing: it's one hour. Not two, not your whole stay (unless it's an hour, somehow). I had sorted by new just to see because it was suddenly people jumping from one hour to this and yeah...it's only free for the first hour. It's pretty apparent on the Metropolis sign on the corner....which is stupid as hell. I know that's not their fault but uh...people come here to watch sports. Sports don't last an hour. That lot 2 blocks down Peachtree is $5 flat until 6am if you come at night, which helps if it goes into overtime or if you decide to go off somewhere else for hours after.So I came here to watch playoff hockey with some friends, and it was like our server was always around until we were waiting for something. And then it took him forever to bring it. And then he did the whole 18% gratuity thing because I guess us sitting there for hours makes us untrustworthy. I was kind of pissed about that because for most of the time there were only 5 of us. Only 5 of us really made up the bulk of the time, and ordered food and everything, and 2 other people came at the end and probably together spent $10. But not my problem if you only want to be tipped 18%.And do not even get me started on the splitting of the check. \"I can't split up the food,\" he said, but somehow we could all pay in amounts. And here I was like oh well we got that but now we're going to have to actually split it by the items. Oh no of course not dollar amounts worked. So we spent like 20 minutes on all this math for really no reason. Welp. Also I am pretty sure the guy who took care of the wings before he left to go see a movie paid the tax and gratuity on them and our server did not let us know that we were going to go over because of that. Nice.So yeah. This place kind of sucks if you're a group but I'm sure since it's close by for a majority of the group we will probably end up back here, blahhhhh. I'm starting us all off w/separate checks this time, I don't need that math. Though maybe after seeing Daniel B's review I can suggest Hudson Grille instead.And oh of course the food is so below average. I'm so glad we could pay over a dollar for two people to get some extra celery, because you know, celery is such a hard to find item and it's especially important to squeeze as much out of a nearly $200 check as possible.

Service was painfully slow -- took nearly 10 minutes sitting at the bar before anyone bothered to take my order.

Once you get to 125 different beers you get a 20oz mug for the price of a 16oz pint, which I think is a great perk.

(heavy sigh)Parking, of course, might be a problem, but let's assume you've conquered that challenge. \u00a0Let's also assume that you're familiar with Taco Mac, and have been in one of their 28 locations. \u00a0That way I do not have to mention the huge attraction, notably the 140 beers on draft, or the selection of over 200 bottles. \u00a0Or the great wings. \u00a0That way, this review is much shorter, and I do not have to type as much.Good! \u00a0I like that.As you enter you see that the designers have made (almost) the most of the available small space, and crafted a functional layout of three levels. \u00a0Each level boasts a wait station, which simplifies wait traffic. \u00a0(As opposed to some locations, where the wait staff looks like the Keystone Kops as they try to maneuver around each other whilst laden with food and beverages.)The top level sports a large comfy bar seating 32 -- although pillar placement hampers seating on the (patron's view) right hand side of the bar, -- augmented with eight high-tops and three booths. \u00a0The bar's jetty breaks up the usual rectilinear monotony, and creates multiple options as you seek just the right combinatorial view of their 1.439 gazillion HDTV's.(Aside: Speaking of pillar placement, why are there so many architectural blunders in modern pubs? Remember the Fado Fiasco? \u00a0This close proximity to Ga Tech should encourage a new Bar Design Architecture specialty. \u00a0I would be more than glad to teach such a course.)There are also two long tables, which at first I assumed to be Captain's Tables (a great feature that encourages small groups of people to talk and socialize more freely with each other), but are actually reserved for large parties. \u00a0Small groups are promptly hustled away should they attempt to alight there.The ambiance is spare. \u00a0A friend complained about the lack of wall decorations, but that criticism falls flat to my ear. Those same tacky decorations are the Go-To's of chain pubs, which may add some prepackaged atmosphere, but offer no utility. Besides, with the aforementioned 1.439 gazillion HDTV's, three is no wall space left! \u00a0The zeitgeist here is simply a lot of TV's with relatively loud audio from a selected game. Like it or move on.The largest drawback here, aside from certain undersized TV's and the lack of purse hooks under the bar, is the service - seemingly the worst in the Taco Mac chain. \u00a0Even though it was a relatively slow Sunday night, I had to wait about five minutes upon arriving while the bar maid chatted up some hunky dude she was flirting with. \u00a0Sadly, there was no improvement once he left, as my wife later also lamented once she joined me. \u00a0Of course, the poor service may have been limited to just my bar maid, something I shall fathom upon a return visit.", "Date": "2010-11-22", "Author_Location": "Atlanta, GA"}, {"Author": "Giancarlo G.", "ReviewID": "8lZgEmAxLe8aqr2nu3OEwg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's amazing what they did to the space if anyone ever remember Stool Pidgeons (which sucked). \u00a0Well, it's Taco Mac beer and wings in a midtown modern setting and there's not a bad view in the restaurant for watching your favorite team.

Love the atmosphere around just because it's in the city with nice buildings around and so many people using the side walks! SERVICE: It started off great and then it plummeted. Definitely hurt my view on this particular location. It was probably due to communication between employees and attitude being shown towards customers. It just takes one person to bring the team down. Story below. I came with a fairly large group (8 people) and were seated within 5 minutes by the hostess. Our waiter showed up promptly after we all sat down and was very friendly and happy. We started off with water as everyone reviewed the menu to decide on what to order. Our order was taken and the food came out. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS WEIRD. Two other servers brought it out; a guy and a gal. They were looking around frustrated to see where our waiter was to pass out the food since she knew who ordered what. I spoke up and let one of the two waiters (the guy) know what I ordered just to help out, but he responded with a smart tone, \"it's okay, we will call it out.\" Kind of like a thanks-for-helping-but-no-thanks-sit-tight- attitude. Well he ended up picking up my plate first and handed it to me. Fast forward, all the entrees were passed out. I asked the same guy waiter if I could have two extra plates since I was sharing my Cobb Salad and 10 piece boneless wings with a friend. He told me he was busy and to wait for my waiter as she will be around shortly with a diva tone. Yeah, she didn't come around until 10 minutes after we gotten our food. I don't blame her. He probably didn't even tell her that her table needed her. Who knows. FOOD: Everything was fine. My Cobb Salad was delicious. Fries are always amazing with the ranch dressing.

At daytime though, its a different experience - I've had extremely attentive servers. My favorite thing about this location would be the bar - it juts out in a semi circle, so the seating is pretty cool. Their beeper system is interesting as well - it goes off when it's time for your group to be seated.Food: Swiss Mushroom Burger, and Wings - any level of Hot. Drink: Any beer you want/like/want to try out. I love their little coasters. So cute. Service: pretty good except when it's super busy. Food comes out 15-25min wait, depending on crowd.

This location used to be the best... They changed the seasoning for the fries and Im sure our baskets sat for a while... Fries were luke warm when they arrived to the table. Long gone are the days where you could get half pound or full pound for boneless wings. Now you get 6 small boneless wings and fries for 6 dollars and some change. My bf got a 10 piece that came to us as an eight piece. Even the house ranch dressing didnt tickle my fancy as it once did. I hate to say it but it looks like the more business they got, the greedier they got and the taste of the food suffered.

That made me a little unsettled about my choice and she quipped that it was 'very hoppy' and also a stronger ale. \u00a0When I got the beer I found it to have very few characteristics of an IPA. \u00a0It was brown in color and I could not detect any hop character at all. \u00a0I asked how long it had been there and she assured me 'about one year'. \u00a0I decided the beer must have gone off and let it go. \u00a0This, however, was not the worst part of my visit. \u00a0When my salad arrived it looked amazing, except for the fact that it was covered in feta cheese which I had asked politely to please remove, as I cannot eat it. \u00a0The staff member who delivered the food, quickly and politely agreed to have the salad remade. \u00a0My server stopped by and apologized for the mistake taking full responsibility and assured me that my new salad would return quickly. \u00a0I told the server, ' accidents happen' and I proceeded to wait for my remade salad. \u00a0When the second salad arrived it did not look very good at all. \u00a0I could tell something was wrong with it so I started to pick at it slowly. \u00a0Very quickly I discovered a large lump of rotten cilantro, an ingredient not included in the menu description, underneath the top portion of lettuce. \u00a0I then began to notice scattered bits of shredded cheddar cheese at the bottom of the plate. \u00a0Also not included in the menu description and also a food item that I cannot eat. \u00a0I stopped eating and asked my server for the menu. \u00a0I looked at the description and noticed that they had also left off the jalapenos, which had made the first salad look very nice. \u00a0My appetite was completely ruined. \u00a0Immediately I remembered, with shock, something that I had read recently. I will post it here for anyone interested in reading it as well. fda.gov/RegulatoryInform\u2026I no longer felt safe eating food from this kitchen, and although I was offered by the kind manager to pay for my food and beer I thanked him and drank my beer and left. \u00a0I will not eat there again. \u00a0I am not even sure if I care to drink beer there again. \u00a0I have seen movies like Waiting and other evil comedies, but I surely hope that type of behavior does not occur in this industry. \u00a0Especially in an organization such as Taco Mac. \u00a0They have several locations, serve several thousand guests daily and have several human staff members. \u00a0Many mistakes are bound to happen, but there is no reason to tamper with a customers food.", "Date": "2011-02-01", "Author_Location": "Forsyth, NC"}, {"Author": "D.L H.", "ReviewID": "Ha4--o7a2BHAEZabFT4Ddw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Taco Mac is the same as Chili's/TGI Fridays except that they have a truckload of beer. \u00a0Reason to go here, most defintely the beer selection and the vast number of tv's to watch sporting events.

You're here for the games, the atmosphere, wings, and beer. \u00a0There are several dozen flat panel TVs in different sizes. \u00a0Usually the audio of the biggest game of the day is on, whatever that may be. \u00a0With regards to viewing college sports, it's close to Georgia Tech so they'll usually play Tech game audio over the others... this is a big plus for an alum like me since Tech games are often put on the back burner at other locations. Incidently, today there's Tech-Wake Forest and Bama(1)-UF(7) on at the same time. I wonder which game they'll choose. Hmm.... Anyway did I mention the awesome beer selection? This place is a true gem in midtown since a real sports bar in this part of town is scarce. \u00a0It's only a few short blocks away from where I live. If I need to catch a game that I can't get at home, I'm here! It's clean, spacious, and the service is very good. The manager always makes his rounds and asks how everything is going while I'm there. \u00a0Awesome beer selection and frankly I've not eaten anything there but wings and nachos of the dozens of times I've been there. \u00a0The wings are generally good but it's a hit or a miss. Sometimes I get really large, juicy wings dipped in plenty of sauce and (unfortunately) most other times I get smaller, tougher, drier ones which have been sitting there too long before refrying (most places will pre-cook wings halfway b/c it takes too long to cook from scratch - not sure about taco mac) or overcooked - I should know, I used to have a restaurant that sold wings. \u00a0Sauce flavor is very good. \u00a0I usually get 10 pieces with fries, add an order of celery (it's cheaper that way than to get celery with wings with an order of fries) and order of extra sauce in a cup (50 cents) so I could dip my wings. If you want wings swimming in sauce, it costs another dollar... c'mon, that's just nickel and diming now. \u00a0But whatever...
