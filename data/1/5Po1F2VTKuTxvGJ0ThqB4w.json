The service was unbelievable, we got there 45 minutes before they closed but were never treated like they were in a rush to get us out.The food was good. We tried the Alfredo and the bolognese. Both were very tasty and the food came out fast. The Alfredo had a slightly different taste of something than I'm used to, maybe a bit more cream, but it was very good.Prices are good and you get large portions. My girlfriend and I could have easily split an entree and been full. Yelp is currently running a deal $20 coupon for $10 which makes the prices even better.

It was not even worth the $10 for the Yelp deal I used to try it. I have no idea how this place has landed four stars, but heed me on this one: do not waste your money here unless something changes drastically!When I saw four stars on Yelp, plus a good Yelp deal, and a menu full of elegant looking pasta dishes, I thought it would be worth a try for a catch up date with a friend. Little did we know what we were walking into. The food was so bad that we were sitting there contemplating leaving it and going for taco bell across the street.I ordered the cheese tortellini in pesto cream sauce with artichoke hearts and it tasted precooked, prepackaged, and just above grocery store quality. The sauce itself was fairly flavorless and I'm guessing came out of a can or a packet. When I hear pesto cream sauce, I'm dreaming of a rich creamy cheesy sauce with the added umph of basil pesto, but this was watery and melted into the bed of marinara the pasta was on top of leaving a runny brown mess that was anything but appetizing.My friend had the spinach and gorgonzola ravioli. I remember this very well because when he ordered it, he accidentally said tortellini and the waiter got confused and looked at him like he had three heads. I tasted the ravioli and it was even worse than my tortellini. It had that flavor that leftovers get from sitting in the fridge for too long--not freezer burn, but that nasty fridge taste that is anything but appetizing or fresh. At around $20 per person, this was in no way worth the money. Even the bread they served before the meal was pretty terrible. It was chewy beyond belief and served with a few poorly roasted pieces of garlic thrown into a lonely looking little bowl. We were only served four half slices of the bread and about four pieces of roasted garlic which was not even roasted enough to spread on the bread evenly. Overall, I definitely should've gone for the taco bell. Cheaper, tastier, and probably even friendlier. Unless this place makes major changes, I think it's in for a short run.", "Date": "2014-04-08", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Esther S.", "ReviewID": "Up5VhE2PMQaPqy0aGDpwdg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a find!!

The tables have heavy plastic table cloths that look bad and are very stiff which makes sitting a tad uncomfortable. The walls are lined with art and other knock knacks which are fun to examine, but do not add to the ambiance.

The pesto cheese bread was okay, although not as tasty as I thought it would be considering that I am in love with pesto sauce. But the entrees were terrible! My lasagna wasn't very warm and bland. No striking tomato or cheese taste to it whatsoever.

And we sat. \u00a0And we sat some more. \u00a0The host (?) who was standing at the door (but also helping to refill water glasses, clear plates, etc.) walked past our table several times, but either did not realize we'd been sitting a while without so much as being offered a drink or chose not to acknowledge this.Finally, a server appeared. \u00a0She asked if anyone had taken our drink order.

I purchased the deal and we headed out the door. The group leaving immediately before us gushed about how wonderful their meal was, which set a great precedent for our meal. We were seated quickly at 8:30pm on a Friday, but the restaurant was definitely pleasantly busy. Menus were presented and the specials read off, but with all of the options we were slightly overwhelmed and not sure of what to order. I informed our server of the check in special and Yelp deal and he marked my special as used before telling me that I cannot use both at once.

The free appetizer was their gnocchi with creamy marinara and honestly could have been a full portion of pasta, it was so big. The sauce was wonderful and full of flavor, but the texture of the gnocchi wasn't my favorite. I like my gnocchi to be soft, melt-in-your-mouth-pillowy and this was heartier, chewier, and doughier-- much better suited for a main course pasta than an appetizer. Regardless, it acted as a perfect vessel for the tasty sauce so I wasn't upset. I had the linguine con pollo piccata and enjoyed the wine flavor in the sauce. Bf had some sort of garlic sauce penne dish with chicken (can't remember what it was called) and I immediately regretted not ordering it because the garlic in the sauce was amazing.

We were seated right away at a small 2 person table - if you haven't been here, it is very small inside with limited seating and it is all table and chair seating. It is a little dim which makes it difficult to read the menus. It took a while for the waiter to get our drink order and when they finally arrived, my soda was completely flat. He changed the tap and brough another glass and again, it was flat (actually it tasted more like soda water than a sprite, there wasn't any flavor and the carbonation was lacking). Since this was a flop, he brought me an Italian Soda instead and it tasted fine. It took a while for him to come back to get our order... we were probably there 30 minutes before we got a chance to order. I ordered the tortillini in gorgonzola sauce and mom tried the chicken marsala. When the food arrived, mine was piping hot and I had to let it cool for a moment, mom's on the other hand was less than warm. Finally after another 15-20 minutes the waitor came back to see how the food was and we told him hers was never even warm. He offered to make her another but by the time it would come out I would have been done eating and we'd be ready to leave. He apologized and boxed things up for us.When he brought our boxed food back, it told us he removed her portion of the dinner and offered us a free dessert for the trouble. We accepted and dinner ended up being quite inexpensive due to the misfortune and my coupon. I understand meals not being ready to go to the table at the same time and sometimes it just happens where one is colder than the other however, I still expect both meals to be hot. I gave 3 stars because the atmospehere was nice, the wait staff was friendly and offered to rectify the error on their own - which goes a long way with me. They were a little slow to get back to the table in reasonable time throughout the meal too.

In fact, I think I was particularly picturing Paula Deen in my head) They were even playing Frank Sinatra songs to seemingly finish off that theme they have going. They like the 50s. They're Italian. They ain't changing for nobody.They started us off with bread and roasted garlic cloves. Oh my goodness. I kept sipping the crap out of my wine to make myself slow down over the bread and the cloves and to ensure my friend got his fair share. Then the food arrived and while my dish was a little on the salty side, it was very flavorful. Also, when it first arrived I thought I would need dessert to supplement my dinner but it was so rich that by the end, I was stuffed and I had to leave a couple of bites on my plate.

Their dishes are flavorful and don't feel like they're drowning in grease or sauce (yet you still get an ample amount for dipping your bread in). Their homemade ceasar dressing is absolutely amazing, and even with take-out, they include some of their delicious warm bread with roasted garlic. My favorite dish is the Chicken Marsala, which rivals the home cooking of a \"straight off the boat\" Italian I know. \u00a0The only \"cons\" I can think about regarding Pasta Bella are that they don't deliver (but really, dining at their establishment is their forte so I can't really fault them for that) and they are slightly more expensive than some of the other \"Italian\" restaurants in the area but in my opinion \u00a0you get what you pay for.

Nicely cooked chicken breast with a lemony caper sauce, just the right amount of lemony goodness, that came atop linguine and a side of veggies that included carrots, broccoli, and zucchini which were very nicely seasoned as well. My fiance had Gnocchi but I dont remember what sauce, it was kind of a creamy tomato-y kind of sauce, it was also very good. The gnocchi were nice and fluffy, but a little chewy and good. My daughter had the kids alfredo with chicken and it was delicious as well. The chicken was well seasoned and the sauce was just the right amount of garlicky creaminess, and the noodles were cooked to perfection. We also had the \"fried ravioli\" for appetizer, which was the only dish that I would say was just \"ok.\" It wasnt the fried ravioli you would get at say, the olive garden. It was not breaded, it was just kind of sauteed so that the pasta part was crispy and then they put a tomato sauce over it, where as im used to having a sauce on the sice to dip it in.

Erik T and I came here a few weeks ago when we didn't know what to have for dinner one night. Driving around Ballard, I had a genius idea! Let's have something GOOD for dinner! Let's go to Pasta Bella! I had previously only dined at the Queen Anne location a couple of years ago with my mom. I didn't think much had changed or that anything would be any different at the Ballard location of this fine Italian restaurant. I was right. The food was great! We enjoyed the complimentary (and delicious!) roasted garlic before our meals were brought to us. I then devoured my entire meal of Linguini Carbonara and Erik made a decent dent in his Spaghetti Bolognese. \u00a0My meal was really superb, and Erik later mentioned he kinda wished he had ordered something a little more adventurous than spaghetti. I had a glass of the house chianti, my usual when I go out for Italian. And it always tastes good. Erik ordered a Blueberry Italian soda. It was so good! We contemplated dessert, but since I had finished my entire meal, I was pretty full and Erik was pretty full, so we declined, though all the dessert options sounded delish. For the meal we had and the dining experience we had, I felt the prices were fair. My dish was $13.95 and Erik's spaghetti was $11.95. The portions were large, Erik had a delightful lunch of leftovers the next day. Erik's Italian soda was reasonably priced at $2.95 and my glass of wine was a deal at $4.95. Erik and I decided that when we go back, we'll probably just get a half carafe of wine, a good deal for $12. Erik and I will definitely return to Pasta Bella, not only because of it's close proximity to our home, but because the food was really good! The restaurant itself is cozy and eclectically decorated. Pasta Bella is a must if you live in the neighborhood.", "Date": "2007-04-28", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Cat L.", "ReviewID": "73RyMJ98BTk1ege4YGDQtA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I thought the food here was delicious! I am very picky when it comes to Italian food, but I loved everything we ate at this restaurant. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the atmosphere (We went to the one on Queen Anne). There's nothing terribly wrong with it, but the decorations and location is a little strange. The servers were prompt, but not very friendly. It felt like they were relatives of the owners helping out, rather than real servers.

The place looks so cozy, they seem to have a lot of regular customers, and usually little hole in the wall places turn out to be gems. Unfortunately every part of our experience there was negative. My soup was room temperature, which was a disappointment since I had a cold and was really looking forward to a steamy bowl of soup. My husband ordered lasagne, and it was still chilled in the center. The worst part is when we told the waitress, she was so rude. She rolled her eyes at us and didn't even apologize. When she came back with the re-heated lasagne, it still was cold. I would have given a higher rating if the staff was at least nice about it, but our complaints of the cold food seemed to be a nusissance to them. Also, I wanted to mention that this happened about a year ago and it's been on my mind since...hopefully they've gotten better.", "Date": "2011-02-24", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Joey G.", "ReviewID": "uaGiLxJV5K7a-4VmswuRZw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent food! great prices!
