On both those fronts we were blown away. Drinks: They have sipping drinks for $5. These are basically big shots that you just slowly drink. What I liked about them was that you could try a variety of drinks essentially without breaking the bank. Food: The food blew me away it was so good. They take traditional bar foods and twist them into crazy new deliciousness. I remember we stayed long enough for the menu to shift (I think from happy hour to non happy hour) and we ordered off both menus. It was delicious each time. We mostly focused on small plates and apps that we could share. I was stuffed by the end. The space was also really interesting and our waitress was very fun, so A+ on that front.I ding them a star though because the live music they had was TERRIBLE. It was guys who thought they could rap (but couldn't) backed up by drum machines and other noise (I say noise because it was not music). It was just loud. While the space is interesting, it doesn't make for good acoustics. We had to shout to each other to be heard. I would definitely try this place again though.61/100", "Date": "2014-07-21", "Author_Location": "Pasadena, CA"}, {"Author": "Teri S.", "ReviewID": "DSb3sf1Rr3fShJzDQZn6Ow", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, haven't been down there in a while and went with a friend to hear some music. \u00a0We ordered small plates to share, and were there at a time where our first order was the dinner menu before 10 pm, and our second one was the late night snacks menu. \u00a0I've been there late before for music, but have never tried the late night menu and have always wanted to. \u00a0Bonus :)Drinks were delightful, as always. \u00a0I had the Man With the Forked Beard (Dark and Stormy). \u00a0OMG, the food...

I guess I'm not all up on the going rate for fresh halibut these days, but I'm pretty sure that chunk of meat costs more than that!Great service, loved the show, excellent food and drink... continue to love this place!

SO much regret that I didn't come here earlier!It's been a while since I've eaten somewhere and truly been blown away by the food, but Icehouse didn't disappoint for a second. For last week's happy hour, we got the fries and the most gigantic buffalo wings I've ever seen. Off of the regular menu, we also sampled the Breakfast for Dinner (crispy pork belly and maple are an amazing combination) and the Ploughman's Platter (a wonderful sampler of smoked meats and other nomz). My mouth is watering just thinking about those dishes, and I haven't even tried the rest of the menu yet! Also...the cocktails. Must. try. all of them.Also, the stage/live music was excellent. Luckily, we were by the window and had a little bit of breathing room from the stage, and I loved being able to catch a performance while also catching up with friends. I'll have to check out their schedule and see a show soon. Everyone else's reviews also capture how awesome this former icehouse/warehouse interior and atmosphere are!

It has been over a year so I was very excited to come tonight since I had such a positive experience the last time I was here. Idk where to begin with this review..1. Late night food menu was on the table-I asked to order the duck poutine -she told me the kitchen was close to closing and wasn't sure if they would be willing to make my food for me - sure enough they wouldn't make it 2. Ordered drinks I felt rushed to make a decision - told us she was planning on leaving soon so we needed to pay and from then on if we wanted drinks to order it at the barHer excuse for the kitchen was it was slow and they had already closed down. Every single restaurant I have ever worked at no matter what if the order was given before the kitchen was closed they made it because the kitchen is still technically open. I understand yes it is frustrating but it's not like the tip for accommodating us wouldn't have been worth it. Next to just openlyTell us to pay out when she wouldn't even get us food was extremely rude. She could have told us she was leaving let us know if we wanted more drinks to order through the bar but not make us feel Un welcomed which \u00a0is completely how I felt. I am embarrassed that I suggested to go here with my boyfriend because the service was horrible.. Food.. Wasn't able to get it and overall felt like our business meant nothing.

We have done brunch and apps/drinks here and every time we leave underwhelmed.Brunch: I had the Brisket Hash and my wife had the Crispy Pork Biscuit. My food was OK, nothing special but a good breakfast. Her meal was a disappointing take on 'biscuits and gravy.' The pork was more dry than crispy and the dijon mustard used was the overwhelming flavor.Apps/Drinks: The drink selection is good and you can usually find something you like. The apps/small plates are OK but forgettable. Nothing stands out.Extra: Disappointingly, if you are seated in the front region of the establishment and stay too late on nights they have music they will ask you to 1.) pay a cover, 2.) move, or 3.) leave. I find this a little odd, especially due to the fact we were not warned of this before being seated.

My family made reservations for Icehouse a few weeks back since my husband and I were coming into town from California. \u00a0We had a party of 7. \u00a0The restaurant is a new and hip venue, a cool hangout for drinks and live music. \u00a0We valet parked (yes, parking can be a little tricky downtown) and had no problems being seated. \u00a0In fact, we were right near the stage giving us a perfect view of the musicians and the restaurant itself. The food and drink menu was super unique with varying food options (Marrow Bone, Duck, foie gras, love it!) and I was impressed with the uniqueness of the small plates, meals and cool drinks. \u00a0My family ordered various drinks from the bar before dinner was even served.For my meal, I decided to get the IceHouse Burger (cooked medium) with salad instead of fries. \u00a0The rest of the family ordered various things on the menu including the pickle jar, meatballs, the King Crab Ravoli, Mushroom Pot Pie and Scallops. \u00a0The waiter, \"Mat S\" was super nice but there were some bumps along the road:1) \u00a0The pinot noir from Oregon (2011) that was ordered did not taste like a pinot. \u00a0We addressed this with Mat who took back the pinot and suggested a zin. \u00a0The zin was excellent.2) The Icehouse Burger that I ordered came out and they mistakenly brought out a vegetarian burger. \u00a0Not what I ordered and we all had to wait while the kitchen fixed the mistake. \u00a0While waiting, other people's food got cold. \u00a0I remember Mat asking me when he took my order how well I wanted my burger to be cooked, so I didn't quite understand the mix-up. 3) My sister-in-law's scallops had a piece of hair in it (long hair that did not look like her own). \u00a0She asked them to take it back and they did so apologetically but not before staring at the plate to find the piece of hair (a little rude...just take it back). \u00a04) Finally, when we got our check at the end of the dinner, they charged me for my Icehouse Burger AND a vegetarian burger (that was never ordered)! \u00a0You mess up my order and then charge us twice! Sigh! It was all a little frustrating to say the least. Overall, when the things were addressed and corrected, my meal was delicious. \u00a0One of the best burgers I've ever had. \u00a0Live music was great and did I mention that their salted macaroons were AMAZING!

I enjoy the live music scene, which Icehouse offers, but the food left much to be desired. My meal, which was supposedly \"the special\" fish, was so salty it seemed as though the cook had gone outside and scraped the salt off the road between snow emergencies and placed it on my plate. The fish itself was breaded, which might have been crunchy at one point, but was drowned in oil beyond repair. The macaroni dish my friend received was the saddest display I had ever seen, with the blandest cheese and likely might have been accompanied by Kraft noodles. Quite honestly, it was baffling as to how limited their \"late night kitchen\" was, in that most dishes were overpriced for miniscule portions, drowned in bland sauce, and overall were barely differing versions of typical bar food. The wait staff takes your order on a smart phone, which is newer to many restaurants, and off-putting to some, as it can appear they are texting and not answering your questions about the menu.The quality of the food had been attempted to be concealed by the live music, which was enjoyable. Note: There was also an entirely pointless entry fee to enjoy the music; pointless due to the fact that it was literally impossible to not hear/see the music unless you were vision and/or hearing impaired. The reasoning behind a secret cover charge, which we did not find out about until arrival, is perhaps an attempt to make up for the lack of tips the serving staff would receive from the mediocre at best \"meals\" offered. The wait staff is also less than willing to be of assistance to customers (noted by deflecting questions to other servers, stating they simply deliver food, or not knowing ingredients in the food - essential to diners with specific dietary needs or restrictions), which was not surprising after the manager reflected this same attitude after he approached my table, seeking our opinion of the food and service. After stating that we were dissatisfied with the price to quality ratio his establishment was providing, he proceeded to send over complimentary desserts; a gesture that would have been better if our main complaint had not been the food. The dessert of choice that evening was macaroons, which were essentially glued to the plate with honey. Why were they glued? After the first bite, it was clear: they were as dry as the Sahara and thus edible glue was entirely necessary to keep the macaroons on the plate.Overall quality music accompanied by sub-par food, unknowledgeable staff, and run by management that does not seem to be as concerned about the dining experience as he might pretend to be during his walkthrough of the restaurant.

It's a loft with large windows, exposed brick and unique woodwork, and almost of all of the dudes that work there rock a beard. There's live music almost every night of the week which is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing when you're in the mood for relatively inexpensive entertainment--the stage is central, the sound is great and you can sit for as long as you like--but when you just want to grab a quick drink or a bite to eat and there's a cover, it's not so great. The food is already kind of pricey.Personally, I love going for drinks because I'm a big fan of the creative $5 sipping shot menu.

Whelp, here it is in plain French. Foie gras is French for \"fatty liver\", the liver of a duck or goose that has deliberately been fattened up to create an amazing delicacy.

Yep, a $22 burger!This burger was definitely the most expensive burger I've ever purchased, but after reading the description, it was a must that I try it. Hey, it was my birthday! Here's that description; Icehouse Burger - seared foie gras, truffle demi-glace. That description needed no further information and my mind was made up, I must try! Now, I must say one thing... If you do decide to try this, and you should, remove all condiments from the table, they should not be used. If you do use them, you'll ruin this masterpiece! I mean really... foie gras and truffle demi-glace on a burger..... like I said, heaven!What did your wife get? Ah yes, she did indeed order a meal as well and that too was one of the best meals I've ever had the privilege of trying as well. Her meal was the Poached Alaskan Salmon served with prawn & potato croquette, chablis and chanterelle - AMAZING! Easily the best Alaskan Salmon I've ever had and a must try. Oh, don't be afraid of the tiny little caviar looking things, they're salmon eggs and they're delicious, so try them!Life is good and so is food, stop wasting your time at the chains and actually try some real food, good food and food that is actually worth eating.

However this review is strictly late night and only based on a few drinks and mostly atmosphere. Absolutely loved this place! Seriously, it was classy, upbeat, and cool. A great place to have a ladies night! My friends and I went to watch a friend preform on a Saturday night, we showed up at 11 pm and it was packed (but not to the point of not having space)! A great sign for a venue! We got some drinks at the bar and within a few minutes a table opened up and we were sipping, talking, and listening in a very pleasant space. There was a lot of talking that distracted from the performance, but the stage is great. The sound system for a small stage/space is excellent, very clear, crisp and basstastic. The space itself is just warm and classic. Friends, first dates, and romantic dinners would all work here. On to the drinks! I got the Quebecois, which is one of their $5 sipping shots made up of bourbon, maple syrup, and bitters. PLEASE if you LOVE bourbon GET THIS!! It was so good and totally worth the money. Though it is a shot, it is a pretty large pour that took me a while to get through. The flavor is sweet, but not too much, it starts bourbon-y and ends maple syrup-y, so good. Just thinking about it makes me happy! OH and the ice! I believe they cut their own ice, and this might be weird, but it was the prettiest and nicest ice I'd ever seen. 2 cubes filled the cup and melting slowly and perfectly. I tried another super weird sipping shot, the Rizzo, which had rye, cynar, fernet-branca, and lemon. I know right, what is that stuff?? All I can remember is the server told me the fernet-branca was some Argentinian liqueur with 15 different herbs infused into it, and that it was almost medicinal. So I had to get it out of pure curiosity. She was right on the medicinal to the point it almost tasted like cough medicine. Not my favorite, but not intolerable. Once the ice melted about half way it was much better. I'm not saying don't try it, just be prepared for the interesting. It's just not my style. The only thing wrong (and obviously didn't take off a star for this) is that when there is a really rockin' band (Such as BeatBox (Whom I saw)) and you want to start grooving, there isn't really a dance area. I get that this is a sit down venue with more chill beats ringing, but sometimes I just gotta dance! Luckily some people in the corner left enabling my girls and I to shake what our mama's gave us without obscuring the view from other patrons. The sound is not so great here because it is pointing out to the center, but still fun! I am so excited to go back here and try more of these crazy drinks they have AND possibly get to the food too. Late night is so great though, if for the cheap cover ( I think the highest I've seen is like $8), the amazing drinks, or that ice cream that I saw some people licking up.

My guy and I stopped in on a moderately busy Friday night, and we were immediately seated in the second floor lounge area where we had great views of the entire first floor including the stage. On the stage, there was a mellow jazz band playing great background music. Our server brought us drink menus, which was an extensive list of unique offerings. Feeling overwhelmed by all the choices, I asked the server for his recommendations that seemed to completely miss the mark on my preferences. So on a whim, I opted for the small, very seasonably priced salted caramel vodka sipping shot; the well-executed drink tasted like a dirty martini with a hint of sweetness.Next, we ordered some snacks to go with our drinks. First, the duck consomm\u00e9 featured perfectly crisp foie dumplings, that were strangling similar to the generic pork dumplings found in any Asian grocery stores, and the tepid consomm\u00e9 tasted like it was crafted using an inadequate amount of bouillon. Next, my favorite dish of the night were the crunchy cornmeal fried oysters were complemented with smokey, peppery gumbo seasoned greens and creamy grits. Finally, the hand cut fries were seasoned well and complemented with unctuous duck gravy, but lukewarm temperature and corresponding soggy texture completely ruined the dish. \u00a0I understand on busy nights mistakes in the kitchen and expediting food are bound to happen, but my biggest disappointment was the server never came to back, except to ask if we wanted the check.

The host told us the wait would be 45 minutes and didn't really seem all that competent. We said no problem, we would wait. Before we even got drinks from the bar he told us he had a table for us. I'm not a big fan of staff that doesn't understand the flow of their own restaurant; you lose business that way and its counterproductive. It was a weird start to an otherwise pretty good dinner. We started out with drinks. I had a half portion of wine (Zinfandel; better deal than paying by the glass if you plan to have more than one) and my boyfriend had a bourbon that the waitress recommended. We both really enjoyed our drinks. After that we decided to share two small plates. My favorite was the Beet Salad, with honey comb, burrata, charred endive, and honey wine vinegar. These were probably the best beats I've ever had; the dish was super flavorful and perfectly sweet. Pretty small portion, but a nice start. We also shared the Barbecued Octopus with braised beef tongue en mole, pickled tomatillo and crema. This was tasty, primarily because of the sauce and sour cream that accompanied it. Both the beef tongue and octopus were cooked nicely, and it was one of the more substantial small plates available. For the main course I had the Short rib Stroganoff. The short ribs were, again, perfectly prepared, and the sauce was pretty tasty. I wasn't blown away, but overall it was a solid dish. My boyfriend's entree beat mine for best bite though, however his was more inconsistent. He had the Icehouse Burger (Hamburger with Foie Gras). I had some issues with his burger: primarily, the hamburger portion was just really mediocre and it was missing something. When you got a bite that had the foie gras on it, it was super yummy, (duh!) but this was only about half the time, and the hamburger itself just wasn't good enough to stand on its own. It could have used some crunch and textural contrast (lettuce, roasted peppers, onions...something!) and a better meet/fat content.To end the evening, we tried two scoops of ice cream. He had the tobacco ice cream and it literally tasted like smoking a cigar (mouth tingle etc). It was kinda good in a weird way though, especially with the bourbon whipped cream. I had the orange flower ice cream, which was nice and light and refreshing. \u00a0The service was great; our server was personable, attentive, and lovely. It did take a while however, for her to take our drink and food orders, but they were busy and that was okay. A nice bonus was some impromptu music during dinner (we were there between the two shows but they still had some live background music). I was pleasantly surprised that we were as full as we were at the end, though I think this was mostly due to our choosing the richest dishes. The ambiance was great and I would definitely be back.

There were about 16 of us going to Icehouse and THANK GOD they took reservations for brunch. We arrived at around 11:30am and were happily surprised to see a live band getting ready to play. We were also a little concerned at the proximity of our table TO the live band - but we are loud, we can yell if we need to. I ordered a Bloody Homer (I mean anything that has a mini donut accompaniment is going into my stomach) to start. The Bloody was REALLY good, spicy and not super tomato-y.

And now this is where things went a tiny bit downhill... the hash was ok. It did not really taste like anything and did not have hardly any brisket in there! The few pieces were so prized that Bob and I ended up fighting over them. I found it to be a little bland and a little soggy? The brioche french toast was good but nothing extraordinary. The apple compote was really good, but there was really none of that on there either. In order to drown my disappointment in my meal I ordered another drink, the Tiki God's Fury. It was AMAZING!

It was fantastic. We had a reservation and they were going to seat us in a booth in the room that didn't have a view of the stage. Being that we were planning on staying a while we wanted to be able to see the live music and they switched us around without a hitch. We sat up on the balcony along the railing. It was fantastic.Atomsphere: Incredible. Music was a little on the loud side but we could still hold a conversation. Definitely not super intimate soft music but it was really entertaining and out of the box. We sat at a small cocktail table. It was cute but the stools were low and didn't have backs on them. Three hours later and our mid-twenty bodies were hurting a bit. Possibly the only thing I would have changed. LIVE MUSIC WAS FANTASTIC.Service: Fantastic. We had lots of questions and asked for lots of recommendations. All of the answers and suggestions were spot on. We even asked for an after dinner drinks spot and again our server knocked it out of the park. We were there for over 3 hours and never felt rushed once. Always nice when it's a busy Valentine's Day.Food: I consider myself a quasi-foodie. I love food. I love great food even more. I wouldn't trade my dogs for food, but I love it enough to pause if someone asked me. This place would have brought me to my knees if I hadn't been sitting. Holy crap on a cracker it might have been the best meal I ever had. And as much as I could have eaten my whole body weight of the foods I got, I appreciated the smaller portions. I left still feeling good in my dress and not like someone had to haul me in a wheel barrel to our car. King Crab Ravioli was freakin' fantastic. Loved it. Not skimpy on the crab at all (and the price showed it but that's next). My boyfriend had the Beef Empanada. Also amazing. I liked mine better and he liked his better. He had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. Holy crap is that stuff good. It came with a maple syrup whip and bacon cornbread. The fried chicken could not have been made better. Beware though, it was a pretty big meal. I had the duck. Fantastic!!! Came with couscous and some other delicious stuff I had no idea what it was. Would recommend all those things!!Pricing: This place will clean out your wallet for sure. Is it worth it? That's probably up to you to decide. I thought there was nothing special about their drinks or wine to warrant $10 a pop, but you know what? Sometimes a little bubbly is necessary.

The worst was the brussels sprouts, which were smothered in onions and a thin salty broth. It takes a lot to make me regret ordering sprouts, one of my favorite foods, but they did it. Finally, we ordered apple pie a la mode, which like all of their desserts comes in a mason jar (why?) and was deconstructed (also why?). That meant that the \"pie\" was cooked apple cubes tossed with little pebbly crust nodules. Everyone at the table was just kind of bummed out. BY DESSERT.

The restaurant is well designed, the food was delicious and interesting, and the cocktails were creative.That dinner made me willing to reserve a table for two on New Years Eve. Unfortunately, that experience made me realize that the above excellent qualities aren't the only ones that make a great restaurant. Here are a few suggestions to improve Icehouse from a two-star review to something higher up on the scale:If you're going to ONLY offer an $85 per person tasting menu on NYE, you should put this on your website, Open Table and other communication channels so that people who are doing research on where to spend their evening are aware and don't show up to an expensive surprise. Also, when your people call to confirm reservations, they should reinforce this detail. The table next to us got up and left when they were handed their tasting menu and told it was $85. If it weren't 8:00 on New Years Eve with limited chance of getting in elsewhere, I likely would have done the same.Don't expect that people will show up for dinner at 8 and want to stay through midnight.Get your kitchen in order and work out those \"bottlenecks\" our server kept complaining about. And on that note, it's appropriate for servers to apologize for slow service, but you probably shouldn't say, \"Sorry this has turned out to be an utter disaster.\" Put on a smile, support your people, and make up for it however you can.Another note for servers: Stop texting, put away your cellphones, and pour wine in my glass that's been empty for 10 minutes. Manager: You're cute. But stop talking with your friends in the corner, realize that your restaurant is struggling to get food on your customers' plates, and help fix it.

The Icehouse gave me one of those rare moments in a Minneapolis fall where I forget winter is coming and that I want to not live here because of it. I've heard about the Icehouse for ages. I was prepared to be highly disappointed....happily I was not. The cocktails list includes a bit of everything (though gin makes more appearances than probably necessary) they offer small and large plates for food and have a stage for music and performances. What's not to love? The interior even made me really happy cause it reminded me of one of my favorite bars in New Orleans. I had the chicken and waffles which was pretty damn good. The waffle was light and airy yet still really filling. The mushroom onion compote and soft boiled egg was a perfect \"sauce\" especially since they don't give you syrup (I'm totally cool with that since maple makes me gag). I could have just the waffle with the compote and be totally happy. The chicken had a really great, crunchy, thick batter and tasted really good. The execution of the chicken had an issue though. My complaint (and one of two reasons they get 4 stars instead of 5) is that they did not remove the chicken skin before frying it. Either other places always do this or they don't and cook it better because the skin left a really gross texture (that you'd rather I not get into) on chicken. It separated from the meat really easily and I could avoid it but then the breading was separated from the meat. Fix this and you have a signature dish to bank on. The other complaint is that we got there at like 8. The Tom Petty cover band started at 11. After spending nearly $50, to stay in the main room where the music was they wanted to charge us a cover. That bothers me. If I clearly came here just for the band I could see that but a. this was a cover band and b. we had already been there for several hours eating and drinking.

It wasn't so bad that the drinks came late, but that the drinks were upwards of $10 a pop. \u00a0I felt like I would have had a better time watching shit telly, drinking a sixer of PBR, and complaining to my Bro-mates about the Vikings, \u00a0for half the cost. \u00a0We just wanted to wet our whistles and relax. \u00a0This was not going to happen. \u00a0 \u00a0Then the music started up, some sort of Jazz. \u00a0It was all right, except I have an issue with laughing at people who play the upright bass. \u00a0The motions are hilarious. \u00a0The whole time the music is playing I am thinking: \u00a0Is he making love to it, is he massaging it, what is he doing, how does the instrument feel???I tried to focus and not laugh, but our drinks weren't coming. \u00a0We kept looking around for what was to transpire and couldn't seem to locate it. \u00a0When our server wasn't making us wait she was asking us questions, well actually yelling at us over the music, telling us about the band, about how excited we should be, and inquiring as to why we were leaving so soon.Honey, we can't wait that long, time is precious. \u00a0My friend kept shaking his head, he literally wanted to just get drinks and not be bombarded with chit chat. \u00a0Finally, the drinks came. \u00a0We gulped them down and bounced on to greener pastures.The drinks were all right, were they worth ten bucks? \u00a0No, but they were all right...All I could think about when I left was how my friend got trapped in the drapes hanging over the entry way door as we entered. \u00a0There were drapes hanging from everywhere. \u00a0These big maroon bastards; it was like a waterfall of burgundy fabric all over the place. \u00a0I imagine these are fire hazards. Icehouse was a mix between a cabin, The Dakota (No offense to The Dakota), and a drape store, with the service speed of an airport terminal. \u00a0I felt the place was over dressed and had a nose-up appeal. \u00a0Yeah, if I wanted to be cool I would say it was an awesome venue as most have, but in reality this bar is a shot in the dark (and I am not being paid for this review by the venue). \u00a0It aims at the trendy and hip, but it forgets the rest, and doesn't even hit its mark.

And by very little I mean that I'll be going back here for sure.As a self-proclaimed technorati, any new innovation in restaurant tech gets me into a \"I'm so glad I live in 2012 mood.\" Icehouse waiters use iPhones to take orders. Why is this cool? No more hassle about splitting bills; easy to change the order; instantaneous transmission to the chefs. You feel like you're in the Apple store. Not only this, but their online menu is mobile-friendly, which is good for me and I'm sure many Yelpers who mainly use the app and are sick of trying to read a 2-pixel font on a restaurant's website.My party of six went at 6:30 on a Tuesday, however I would still recommend making a reservation as this place is ramping up in popularity (a la \"Butcher and the Boar\", another new American restaurant that recently sprang up).The Icehouse espouses the \"small plates paradigm\" by offering several (unique) smaller entree options. I have come to appreciate this model as it offers the diner a more varied experience while not putting all your eggs in one basket. Our party tried a good portion of the menu but some of the highlights included the dry-rub buffalo wings (these were amazingly flavorful; just order them!), market fish, gulf shrimp, and swiss burger. It's easy to order too many things if you're feeling hungry, but I find that as we went through the meal, to order as you go was an efficient solution.Icehouse is not the place where you have a huge entree and call it a night. You have to carefully navigate their very unique drinking menu ($5 sippin' shots will have you intrigued) and order a few small plates. The waiter made a recommendation to get a salad, small plate, and drink, and that would be enough to fill us up.

There was a band -- a keyboard and some big string instrument, sorry I'm not so musically-inclined. I normally don't like bands while I am dining.

Both were extremely strong, but extremely tasty. I'm in love.They have a great patio on the side of the building slightly looking out on Nicollet Ave., and the interior of the building is also really cool - kind of a warehouse-y, moody space that's perfect for grabbing drinks and food while listening to the live music that they have really frequently. Some of the shows are free, some have a cover, but either way, it's definitely worth it to experience the atmosphere and great feel of this place.My only gripe is that Icehouse doesn't offer any happy hour specials on food, and they offer a very limited menu in between lunch hours and dinner (3 sandwiches and a few side pasta/potato/green salads to choose from).

\u00a0Is he incapable of using the POS or something?) \u00a0After at least ten minutes of debating, and since our waitress hadn't even shown up yet, I returned to the hostess and asked AGAIN for a table near the music (the table I had reserved and confirmed!!), but she said there could be a wait. \u00a0I said I was willing to wait. \u00a0I felt annoying and like an inconvenience -- why should I have felt like that? \u00a0We waited by the bar and each got a cocktail, which we drank in a cramped space where we were consistently in the way of traffic.Okay, 'nough said about that hassle. \u00a0We finally got the table we wanted by 7:45, a half hour after we reserved it. \u00a0(Also, I think it is worth noting that if you sit at a two-person table by the music only ONE of the people faces the music... \u00a0I think the tables should be rotated 90 degrees.) \u00a0And HERE is where we encountered the SAVING GRACE OF OUR ICEHOUSE EXPERIENCE -- our waiter, Kevin H! \u00a0He was friendly, professional, courteous, knowledgeable, and prompt... all the things I hope to find in a server. \u00a0Kevin, if you're reading this, those two stars are for you! \u00a0And thanks.Note: \u00a0The music was really great, but I'll attribute that to the musicians themselves.Onto the food and libations. \u00a0The drinks we got at the bar (Silver Sombrero and Dark and Stormy) were tasty and boozy -- the way I like 'em. \u00a0We ordered fries with two sauces for $5 as an appetizer. \u00a0We got a portion of fries in a metal canister the size of a beer koozie. \u00a0Where I work, we sell a heaping plate of fries for $5. \u00a0I'm sayin' -- there was way more sauce than needed for this small amount of fries. \u00a0And potatoes are seriously cheap... \u00a0I just don't see the need for skimping here. \u00a0I got the Mixed Grains salad... \u00a0I was happy with it. \u00a0Tasty, interesting, and healthy. \u00a0The size of my $12 entree, the Mushroom Pot Pie, did not seem $12-sized, but it was very flavorful and actually filled me up just right. \u00a0My boyfriend's $20 Baby Back Ribs were substantial and had a good flavor but were pretty tough, and he only had a butter knife to cut them with. \u00a0First of all ribs should be tender, and secondly if they're not they should be served with a steak knife! \u00a0Our post-dinner beer was good, and my scoop of chocolate ice cream was REALLLY good.Now, here is my final complaint about this place. \u00a0After missing our reservation, which created a hassle both for us AND the hostess, WE WERE NOT APPROACHED BY A MANAGER. \u00a0I'm pretty sure I know who he was -- a bald guy with a big black and gray beard walkin' around. \u00a0I noticed him schmoozing with the band for an extended period of time, but I guess he didn't have the time to try to create a better experience for his paying customers. \u00a0Okay, manager -- a table touch would've been nice, and some free drinks would've been even nicer. \u00a0As a manager you have the power to make someone a returning customer or someone who will never return. \u00a0(Can you guess which one I am now?)Maybe I am being overly sensitive or picky about this, but in all honesty the mix-up with our reservation caused us to have to come up with entirely new plans for our night because we couldn't make it to the next thing we wanted to do at 9:00. \u00a0I wouldn't be frustrated with spending the money there and to get there if only the experience had been good.I tipped the hostess on the way out 'cuz for all I know it wasn't her fault we didn't get the table we wanted (there appeared to be multiple hosts), and she had to work to get us the table we wanted. \u00a0If we hadn't gotten that table in our great waiter's section, the whole thing would've blown. \u00a0My boyfriend disagreed with my tip.THE END.", "Date": "2013-01-28", "Author_Location": "Duluth, MN"}, {"Author": "Justin K.", "ReviewID": "7iYxXzY0hMZPtf0e8vtbUg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After some considerable thought, I've come to the realization that Ice House has managed to discover a sixth taste (after sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami). \u00a0What is this magical sixth taste, you ask? \u00a0Regret. \u00a0That's a strong statement, yes, and it doesn't apply to everything, but I can tell you definitively that one of Ice House's signature dishes, the foie gras burger, is loaded with it. \u00a0The cooks discovered this flavor when they took a perfectly decent, though already overpriced, burger and topped it with a puny piece of seared duck liver and then drowned it in a tasteless Bordelaise. \u00a0All this for the eye-popping price of $22 (before downtown Minneapolis tax and tip). \u00a0There isn't much complexity to it aside from the richness of the foie gras, but it's so small, you only get 1-2 bites of it before you're left with just beef and bun. \u00a0While it does come with a side of very good fries, which isn't mentioned on the menu, if the dish was put on the stock exchange, the return on investment would be somewhere between Enron and Facebook. \u00a0A friend of mine, who went on a different day, reported an identical experience with the burger, so this isn't just one cranky yelper spouting off to get his jollies. \u00a0There's a lot left on the menu to explore (see below), so I just want people to go with proper expectations. \u00a0If you're still craving a burger, I hear The Blue Door Pub is opening up next door any day now...Ok, so that's the major downfall of the place. \u00a0The other is the slow and rather inattentive service when the restaurant was otherwise empty during a Saturday at lunchtime, but that could have just been an off day. \u00a0They were, however, willing to split the two dishes we ordered so that we could try them both, which was very nice. \u00a0It could be better during a busier time, when adrenaline might make things move faster. \u00a0Stranger things have happened. \u00a0But it was definitely noticed.One thing that saves this place, and in my eyes, the one reason I would consider going back, is the cobb salad. \u00a0Made with crisp bibb lettuce, silky house-cured pork belly, garlicky croutons, ripe bleu cheese and two mouth-watering poached eggs, this will make you forget all your other worries and spoil every future salad you will ever have anywhere else. \u00a0It's that good. \u00a0Get that and you'll even forgive them for charging $22 for a stupid burger!", "Date": "2013-01-06", "Author_Location": "Minneapolis, MN"}, {"Author": "David C.", "ReviewID": "KHGkl1HoihZWpiANzkAVOQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great dishes, great service, splendid venue, and live music! \u00a0They have live acts on certain nights, and definitely capitalize on their terrific drink menu. \u00a0The crowd is cool (albeit slightly older) but definitely alot of fun. \u00a0I think you should come here is you are looking for a more laidback night, \u00a0Doesn't quite have the same energy as a nightclub, but will satisfy you immensely if you are looking for something more low key.", "Date": "2013-04-24", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Anthony M.", "ReviewID": "isJ1Rr6z6gFAuxC-MQHkVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hands down the best place Ive been to in Minneapolis in a very long time!BEST CHEESE STEAK SANDWICH EVER!!!!Do yourself a favor and check this place out as soon as possible :)", "Date": "2012-08-02", "Author_Location": "Andover, MN"}, {"Author": "Emma R.", "ReviewID": "4g_YKW3RN5AVDTJSbqeI-g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An evening at Icehouse is what you might expect from Matt and Brian's new venture.

The first time we ate here, we had a great experience but after the last two TERRIBLE meals I felt it necessary to re-review to balance out my original rating.I'm typically an optimistic and positive diner, but this place needs to get its shit together. First off - the servers use iPhones to take your order which is really distracting and impersonal. The server is just staring at a phone the entire time they are talking to you, and every time we saw our server he was standing somewhere fumbling with the phone. It just made for a weird experience. Then there was the lack of attention. Okay granted, we used the Groupon on both of these awful trips but if that is cause for wait staff to completely ignore you then the coupon idea is a major failure.Bad Experience 1: brunch. Server was pleasant, and at first things were fine. We got our drinks pretty quickly and placed our order. But then our drinks were empty (and we would have ordered more) and we waited 30+ minutes for our food to come out. Not once during this time did he come by the table. We tried to catch his attention but every time we saw him he was either on the iPhone in the corner or walked by without acknowledging us. Our food came out (not our server), we ate, and still no check in from the guy. We still had a beer left to order from our Groupon, and we finally ordered after he came by to take our empty plates. Ahhh! If the food was fabulous, I might have been a little more forgiving but the hash I ordered was unappealing and tasted like it had been prepared on a dirty griddle. I honestly would have preferred a bagel from Brueggers.Bad Experience 2: much to our dismay, we bought two Groupons because of our first great experience. This time we had lunch. I do have to say the sweet girl bussing our table was very nice and attentive. But again, the service from our waiter was awful! The stupid iPhone distraction is horrible. We again waited forever to be asked if we wanted another drink (which we did because they do have some tasty cocktail sippers!) and the guy walked by our booth maybe five times without ever even looking at us. Food was totally disappointing and my boyfriends Reuben came out on soft wheat bread. I'm sorry, but you better have some tasty toasty rye bread in back if you're going to put dear Reuben on your menu. My burger was so greasy that the bun was soggy. The other sandwich that was ordered was ho hum.Bleh. We will never go back to Icehouse. I hope for their sake they read these reviews and 1) rethink the iPhone thing...definitely not in any way helping their image; 2) hire some competent wait staff; 3) fine tune themenu and pay attention to the details.", "Date": "2012-12-30", "Author_Location": "Minneapolis, MN"}, {"Author": "Mahad M.", "ReviewID": "pi3vKT7EOQZVZtthRTZv9g", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "WARNING: This is not the place for you if you're a hungry guy or gal.I was dropping a friend who lives nearby, after a long weekend of camping. We needed a meal and a few drinks, so we stopped by here around 5pm on a Sunday.The ambiance and the decor of the place are unmatched, compared to any place down on Eat Street. It's welcoming and almost perfect for a date.It was a bit loud; some folks were playing Cello on the stage, so we decided to sit on their patio, looking out partly into Eat Street, the parking lot, and Vertical Endeavors. Our server (Chris) using an electronic device to take our order was phenomenal of his knowledge of the menu and his overall demeanor. A guy came out running with a water bottle and then the menu arrived. One glance at it and I knew we were at the wrong place for a wasteful, gluttonous night. Chris did tell us that they've only been open for a couple of months and so far are testing the menu. We ordered the Sloppy nachos + Meatballs cheese sauce + house-cut fries with duck gravy & harissa sauces. My buddy had about three cups of their California red wine, I had two summits. We were hungry, so we couldn't resist ordering their buttermilk pie and peanut butter banana cream. I can see myself coming back here just for these two pies.

It was on my summer bucket list, and now that summer's going to be over in a few days--well of course I had to go.The restaurant is in an unexpected area, I thought; it kind of sticks out like a sore thumb among all the ethnic stores and restaurants. But the interior (and exterior) are beautiful! The waitstaff and others working here match the look, with neutral clothing and rustic hipster-ish----everything. So you get the whole experience when you go here. I think it's a nice, rich atmosphere that makes it easy to relax and enjoy the food.And the FOOD. Was SO good. But let's talk about the drinks first. I might get too far ahead of myself... I planned for this moment, because I know there was no way I was going to be able to order if this was my first time looking at the drink menu. So after much thought I was able to walk into the restaurant confident that I had to have the butterfly kiss. Like egg white and olive oil in my drink? Yes please! Give me some of that experience! Doesn't sound like something I could get anywhere else, so I got it. There was a subtle temp difference between the egg whites on top and the cool alcohol below. The creamy butteriness that was the egg and olive oil blew my mind when paired with the sweet apricot-lemon flavors. And this drink packed a good punch. There were three other people in my party, so of course I tried other drinks. My favorite was the Summer something, with strawberry and balsamic. It's like a burst of fresh strawberry in your mouth. It could be dangerous in large quantities, because it's so tasty. I also really enjoyed the blueberry collins. The golden margarita was sort of just a margarita. It was probably made with really good ingredients--but still, nothing super special to it. NOW onto the food. I'll try to make it short. Let's kick off the food section by saying the french fries at Icehouse are the BEST french fries I've had (matchstick fries, not waffle). I didn't really know what I wanted from a french fry until I tried these, so you just need to get them. Crispy, little salty, good dipping sauce(s). Salad: I got the beet salad, which was the most fantastic choice. The salty crunch from the ham, the creaminess from the quail eggs, the pepperiness from the arugula, and the tanginess from the beets were unbeatable. This was one of my favorite parts of the meal. Small Plate: Ordered the eggplant cannelloni. It was good, but I might have enjoyed something else a little better. It's not because this dish wasn't all it could be--because I think it was. It was SO well thought-out, but eggplant stuffed with kind of mushy summer squash concoction, swimming in another concoction (aka broth). TASTY! But something in my desired a lil somethin different.Etc: I tried the sweet corn flan in my bf's lobster entree. It was super cool! The smoked chicken was also really moist and good. This is a good option if you're on the hungry side.Dessert: I had the coconut cream pie with lime curd. Love! The top was super creamy, with a subtle layer of lime curd on top of a crispy crust. Perfect. The Chocolate souffle cake was also really good. I've had something like it elsewhere though... I wish someone would do something mind-blowing with chocolate! But if you're craving chocolate then this is a great answer to your body's calling. Phew! Ok done with that.My only complaints about this place are... 1. The menu descriptions. The menu doesn't list half the things in each dish, so you're bound to be surprised by what you order. I get the thinking behind this, but I'd much rather know what is in each dish. 2. The prices *felt* a little much for the portion sizes. I think that's because I'm used to walking out of a restaurant feeling totally stuffed after paying a similar price for my food. BUT! the food quality it top-notch! It's something the Twin Cities have to get used to! Can't wait to go back for lunch and more drinks.

It's this well-designed behemoth of a building that used to be an actual icehouse and then a production studio, so I hear. It's industrial and modern, without being cold. There's a balcony lining the walls as well as plenty of seating and a big bar downstairs. The live music stage takes, well, center stage, but there's also room in the back for quieter dining. The first night they were open to the public, we ended up sitting on the patio overlooking the nice Vertical Endeavors rock garden. The cocktails are by Johnny Michaels (of La Belle Vie fame) and he really outdid himself. I've tried quite a few of them between my own and tasting my friends', so here goes...Signature Cocktails: (These are in order of how hard I would slap you if you tried to steal each particular drink out of my hand.)-On Blueberry Hill: It's a blueberry gin collins with cardamom and vanilla. It's balanced and refreshing and perfect. THE best summer drink.-Some kind of tangerine margarita-Butterfly Kiss: chamomile-infused something with egg white, olive oil... This was my friend's drink and it was pretty great, but I wish I could remember all the ingredients.-The Taste of Summer: with balsamic, tasted like a fresh, homemade strawberry popsicle (speaking of which, there actually IS a drink here that comes with a popsicle)-Watermelon Man is a pickled watermelon collins that I don't think I'd order again. It wasn't bad, but just not my favorite.-Colonel Mustard: \"A $1 shot of whiskey from a mustard bottle. Available at the bar only.\" I didn't try this, but I appreciate it almost as much as I appreciate that they make their own ginger beer.Rocks Cocktails: (If you're on a budget and still want something really boozy, try the $5 rocks cocktails. These are a steal in comparison to similar drinks in other bars. The rocks menu includes two of my favorites as well.)-Satan Laughs & Spreads His Wings: bourbon, spicy bitters and a nutty, caramely liqueur. Despite the name, this was absolute heaven. Track it down and order it immediately. If this is ever taken off the menu, I will cry.-La Samba: this orange-cinnamon caipirinha is soo interesting and good. This would be perfect at brunch, actually.-The extra smoky sazerac is OK if you like super smoky flavors. It comes with a pine-smoke absinthe-soaked glass.Now for the food. My friend and I went a little crazy the first night because everything sounded so good. We started with a couple of small plates: the yummy duck plate (confit fries, roast duck with blackberries and foie gras on a perfectly aromatic spiced cake) and then the empanada trio (same beef empanada with three different sauces---these were good, but could maybe be improved with varied fillings too). The small plates are small, as advertised, but ours were tasty. Then I ordered the cheesesteak, which is impossible to eat like a lady. It's sandwich packed full of brisket, spicy giardinera and bleu cheese fondue as a sauce and the flavor is worth the trouble of looking like an animal during feeding time. The burger with peppers and bacon with a side of crispy fries with harissa? OMG, just go there already. To finish off our meal, we ordered a slice of rhubarb pie to share. Pie. I love that they have a whole menu of pies, which are my favorite kind of dessert. Surprisingly though, the pie wasn't even my favorite part of this dessert. It comes with a scoop of rose creme fraiche sorbet on top that stole the tastebud show. They have a whole menu of house sorbets and I'd recommend one of the sundaes or the trio of mix-n-match ice creams (the bourbon scoop comes with a mini donut!).This review is becoming a novel, but I can't leave out the service, which was also tops. So genuinely nice. It's regular table service at night and then cafe-style service at lunch. And note that they are not texting when they are at your table... they are putting your order into their futuristic system. They can also check your IDs with a single swipe and run your credit cards right there. Though I think I would actually prefer if they stepped away from the table to do the credit cards (even just a few steps). It's a little awkward when someone's hovering over your table, no matter how nice they are. Usually I have to wait until \"things calm down\" or \"the place gets their footing\" until I feel comfortable leaving a review, but I just couldn't wait to give up all the stars for this place.

Finally had dinner here with some friends, and it met my (heightened) expectations. The restaurant is spacious, has great lighting, and great acoustics. Even as the dinner crowd started building, I noticed I didn't have to start speaking loudly; this restaurant is also a music venue, and I can't wait to come back for a musical treat along with my delectable one. The menu is a limited list of small plates, entrees, and bar food. I was debating between a couple of options, including the chicken, a couple of bar food items, and the rabbit. I eventually went for the foie gras and truffle burger, because I'm a baller, no doubt. This burger was quite amazing, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and had some uneven textures to it, which makes sense as the meat is ground in-house. The truffle wasn't overpowering, and the foie gras was this luxurious, smooth meat icing on top of the cake. And, as fancy as this burger sounds, consuming it is anything but. It's ridiculously juicy, so get a bib ready.The fries that come with it have a great crispy skin outside, and you can choose the dipping sauce. I went with the duck gravy, which actually had a little bit of the duck meat in it. Ri-freaking-diculous. My friend also ordered a burger and I got to try the lemon aioli she had, and that was lovely as well. For dessert, I tried the bacon and brown sugar sunday because, duh. It's bacon. And brown sugar, In a dessert. Definitely a must-try when you come here. It's not as odd a combo as it sounds; little bacon bits on top provides a bit of saltiness with the cool sweetness of the brown sugar ice cream. It was just a great finish to a stellar meal.

For some reason, I initially imagined it would be more like a \"Famous Dave's\" chain store type place. Boy, was I wrong. The restaurant has a cool dark vibe, a huge contrast to the more \"neighborly\" restaurants on Eat Street. I don't think I've actually been to a restaurant in Minneapolis where it felt legitimately \"cool\" until now. Ice House is classy, sexy, cool. There is an inexplicable allure, dark, worldly and mysterious. The spacious stage is the center of the restaurant and the star as it entices us with \"come-hither\" tunes from talented musicians.As enamored as I am with the atmosphere and tasteful interior design, I did encounter one annoying flaw about the place. My friend and I were seated on the second floor balcony by the wall. On this wall is a huge red pipe that runs horizontally across the entire wall, which, when seated, is right next to your head. \u00a0It's a funny thing to be annoyed about I suppose, but, I don't like sharing my \"head\" space with a gigantic red pipe. I wanted to move the table and chair another 2 -3 feet away from the wall so that I could feel more comfortable and relaxed. \u00a0Next time, I'm getting a reservation specifically for the 1st floor area, where red pipes aren't trying to throttle your head. Oh, now, about the food. We had the smoked trout with walnuts and the truffled cheese souffle salad. The salads are portioned sparsely but are delicious! For those accustomed to HUGE American sized portions, this salad would disappoint you, portion-wise it's tiiiny. \u00a0I was quite pleased with the size(and tastiness) though considering I hate American monster sized portions anyway. Then, I had the reuben style pastrami sandwich, which is a regular-sized hearty sandwich but unfortunately not that great. All I tasted while eating that sandwich was the heavily creamed mixed greens that they slopped on top of the pastrami.In any case, I'd love to stop by Ice House more often to try out the cocktails and other items on the menu.

The third time back, consistent in terms of mediocre food and a long wait for food in a half empty restaurant/bar, but this time the service, well, it was odd. The gentleman was clearly only half there - we had to remind him several times of things we ordered, but didn't receive. In addition, he simply lacked any social skills, mumbled when speaking, no smile, no basic manners when a 'please' or 'thank you' was appropriate. After we'd finished dinner, they needed to move us from the dining room to the bar as our table was needed for a large reservation - no problem, the manager offered a drink on the house for any inconvenience. \u00a0But as we were getting up to move, our waiter mentions, 'they've been on me for the last half hour asking if you're going to order more food or if your leaving or what'. So strange, as we'd been essentially ready to go for 20 minutes but waiting for him to bring the bill. There are simply too many alternatives in the Twin Cities, and, in THAT neighborhood, that offer better food and service.", "Date": "2013-01-27", "Author_Location": "Longfellow, Minneapolis, MN"}, {"Author": "Mpls A.", "ReviewID": "oUG6zHzm73b_EPbUm8_NjQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good food, great cocktails and A+ staff. \u00a0Whether going for a small nosh or a morning bloody, all of our experiences at Icehouse have been better then the prior. \u00a0They also may take the cake for the best bloody in town.

The portions aren't huge but the quality is so high that you savor each bite much more than you would at a typical restaurant. \u00a0I could see him resisting licking both plates after he finished because they were sooo good. \u00a0I had the lobster fettucini which was a good portion size with 2 large pieces of lobster (tail and claw) sitting right on top. None of those tiny nibblets of lobster you might find at another restaurant. \u00a0Our only advice would be to serve a little bread on the side because all the dishes had such well developed sauces that it was a shame to leave any of it behind on the plate, and soaking them up with bread would have been heavenly. Alas.Our luck was high because shortly after he polished off the duck and beef, the kitchen accidentally made an extra duck plate and brought it to us! I finally got to try a little bit of everything and it was heavenly. I'm usually disappointed in the non-alcoholic beverage selection at restaurants, but they actually had a number of good options (I think I had a ginger limeade, but it's not listed on their website menu, so I can't be sure.) \u00a0I want to try everything on their dessert menu, but started with the blueberry pie with sweet corn ice cream. The flavors worked well together for a solid dessert, though I prefer a thinner, flaky crust and this was a bit dense. Not a deal breaker though.Only semi-complaint was that it took a while before anyone came to greet us or bring us water once we were seated. The waiter was a little bit of an odd duck and seemed nervous or maybe he's just an awkward guy, but once we got used to his personality it was all good. He did provide solid service throughout the evening. As an interior designer, I really enjoyed the decor and atmosphere Shelter Architecture created throughout the space.
