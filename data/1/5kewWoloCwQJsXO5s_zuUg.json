As of recently, I've had the baguettes from Lee's and they are a life changer LOL. I went to go pick up some more and my friend and fellow yelper convinced me to try the sandwich. It's made on the same baguette bread, a 10\" piece, so I knew I was destined for greatness. I got the chicken and they did not skim. The reason why I am giving a 4 star is here- there were many pink pieces. I don't think it was undercooked, it may just be the cut. The sandwich comes with pickled carrots, daikon, onions, jalape\u00f1o and cilantro. Each flavor works with each other and perfectly compliments each other. I will definitely be back to get myself more baguettes and sandwiches.", "Date": "2014-04-24", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Dennis N.", "ReviewID": "Sql8Jo8zC_9i_fwDkULebA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This place is not the best Vietnamese sandwich shop around. I would have given another star for this review, but the customer service was horrible the last time I was there.I was there on a weekday evening. There was an older lady trying to place an order. The cashier was a young Vietnamese punk. The lady wanted a salami sandwich. He asked \"What number is it?\" I guess the lady ordering was not familiar with numbers so she asks for \"Salami\". Again, he asks for the number for the sandwich. After a few minutes of going back and forth, he says that they don't have a salami sandwich.They actually do have a salami sandwich. Not sure if there is a number, but they definitely have a salami sandwich. There is a big sign behind the cashier's head that says \"Salami Sandwich\". I guess he is too much of a douche to turn his head around and look at the menu. Or, he should already have some knowledge of the menu. He made no effort to look at the menu behind him.The owner of this Lee's Sandwiches establishment needs to step in. Sure it was just one customer that I saw that had a problem, but I can't say how many times this has already happened.Anyway, the food itself is not horrible. It is not really as authentic as it was 15 years ago.

Without saying anything (I'm sorry, my mistake, here you go, etc) she gives me the correct change and appears to be pissed off at me. I thought it was just a strange encounter on a strange day. However, as I drove home I thought, \"Wait a second. Cash only. Shorted me by $0.50. Seemed pissed of at me for her mistake.\".

Please let me elaborate on my experiences.First Fail:I bought a BBQ pork sandwich like I always do from any Lee's Sandwiches. I got home and began to enjoy it. As I pulled away to adjust the veggies, guess what I saw staring right back at me....that's right ladies and gentlemen I found a nickel sized shiny green beetle, DEAD, in my sandwich.No lie, I practically had to try and throw up what I just ate. Where did that beetle come from? God knows where! But SERIOUSLY?????Second Fail:Thinking to never buy their sandwiches, I began to buy their little pastries they have set out on their counter. My favorite WAS this green, purple and white jelly thing that I tend to buy every so often I got a chance to go there. Thinking that they wouldn't fail in that category, I was dead wrong. I bought two little plates of those jelly things and went to my car. As I opened the packages, this weird aroma fill my car. I noticed that the bottom the styrofoam plate was covered in this kind of goop,(a goop that would appear if something was spoiled. Yes, people...these people just sold me SPOILED food. I looked at my second plate thinking it was a fluke, I was wrong...I found MOLD growing on the food. I quickly returned both plates to get my money back. As I was returning the food(which is something I really don't do at all), I noticed the rest of their jelly kind of pastries were secreting that same kind of goop I found in my plates.This is just a glimpse of what I've gone through.
