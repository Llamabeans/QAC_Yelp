We stumbled upon Past Perfect and for many reasons, I'm glad we did.This location was a little drab for me. The avocado green and adobe colored walls seemed to clash. The bar arches and fake vines that lined it made for a sort of outdated place. What I did like was the Lincoln photo and huge American flag that lined the ceiling. It remained consistent to the name of the location. The bathrooms of this location was a complete dump and needs to be deep cleaned. Lastly, another focal point to this joint was the long bar top, which offered lots of bar seating. While we were there, we tried a couple of drinks. For starters, the happy hour included $2 pints of bud light, so you know I just had to get that the whole time. Another \u00a0highlight of this place was the fact that they infused their own vodkas. We decided to try their habanero infused vodka and see how hot it really was. It went well in the bloody mary we ordered. WOW, was it hot! This vodka is not for the faint. You'll need to love hot things and have tough skin to enjoy this. For me, I could not handle. After a sip, I tapped out lol!Past Perfect was the right location for a few drinks before our Yelp party. I'm glad that we stumbled upon this place as we had the opportunity to try some great drinks at a low cost.

This is another one of those instances where I have to break it down...so here goes: GOOD: Service. The server/host who helped me was nice, helpful, friendly and a pleasure to work with. He seemed to really enjoy recommending items he enjoys. GOOD: Vodka! The vodka at this joint is infused at the bar. They do it themselves. (That's what she said!) And they do a great job. The coconut vodka is not sweet, just has a nice, strong essence of coconut and makes a delicious, refreshing straight martini. In fact, I really, really enjoyed the coconut vodka. The ginger was more interesting, more spicy and a more complicated flavor. There were little tiny bits of ginger left over from the infusion process that actually added to the flavor and drinking experience. Now, I am not one to love ginger when it is not subtly utilized, but this is an exception. The ginger taste was strong, but not too sharp and spicy, so a definite success! GOOD: Location. I love the back-alley feel of the joint. \u00a0I went there in the middle of the afternoon, but I can imagine the interesting mix of people the place might draw later at night and at lunchtime.OKAY: Soup. \u00a0I had the asian chicken soup. \u00a0Now, I have to say the concept is interesting. \u00a0And from Top Chef, I have learned this: the concept was great: chicken soup with white meat chicken breast and asian inspired vegetable mix and hints of ginger and other Asian Spice. \u00a0Unfortunately, the bowl I received was NOT fresh. \u00a0It was actually kind of old. \u00a0The chicken was so dry and tough. \u00a0The vegetables were cooked until they were soggy. \u00a0But, it tasted good, does that make sense?I really like Past Perfect, I not only recommend it, I would LOVE to go there again if I were to return to Nashville.", "Date": "2008-12-09", "Author_Location": "Trabuco Canyon, CA"}, {"Author": "Amanda W.", "ReviewID": "tN64abNgurjNVmVTQIFkqA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Upon each visit, it boggles my mind that this place doesn't have more patrons.

Don't be like me! Downtown parking and traffic makes it impossible (at least for me) to be a regular here, but if you already work downtown or if you're heading to a hockey game or a concert it's the perfect place to stop before or after. It's definitely one of downtown's hidden gems. Up until today I'd only been to Past Perfect for the drinks. They have a giant list of infused vodkas, a great happy hour and more often than not a sign out front with a drink special for the day. It's speakeasy-meets-lower-Broad - the drinks are so much classier than what you'd get at your average bar on Broadway, but I wouldn't call them artisan. It's a nice in-between. I stopped in today for lunch and was surrounded by people raving about their bloody marys, though I didn't partake. (side note: Sometimes I feel like the only person on earth who can't stomach the idea of drinking tomato juice. C'est la vie.) My friends and I all ordered off the brunch menu, because seriously... Who can resist eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce? I got the Eggs Chesapeake, two halves of an English muffin topped with roasted red peppers, crab cakes, poached eggs and the aforementioned hollandaise. It was delicious. The hash browns that accompanied the meal were nothing to write home about, but who am I to complain about potatoes and cheese? One of my friends ordered a similar dish but with steak instead of the crab cakes, and my other friend ordered the biscuits and gravy. If you never thought of biscuits and gravy as a meal, think again! We all loved our meals. Prices were around $10 for everything on the brunch menu, the regular menu is similar with dishes ranging from $8 (burgers, wraps and sandwiches) to $12 (pasta dishes) to $18 (steak and ahi tuna).

I had a sazerac and my friend had a manhattan, very basic cocktails. \u00a0They came out watered down (basically clear), bland, and amateurish. \u00a0Unfortunately the prices were not far off of other fine bars in Nashville whose cocktails are infinitely better (cough..holland house..cough..308). \u00a0Of course when the food finally arrived it was thoroughly unimpressive. \u00a0To top it off when I had to use the gentleman's room I saw a kitchen staff member walking out of the bathroom with a large metal mixing bowl. \u00a0I walked in to find that he had dumped a huge amount of ice in the urinal. \u00a0I have no idea why the hell ice was dumped in the urinal and not a kitchen sink or what that mixing bowl was used for afterwords, but I did not touch the food following that. \u00a0 It honestly blew my mind as to what scenario that would be appropriate and was one of those things that make you question a whole establishment. \u00a0Overall Past Perfect is kind of like that girl that you run into in the back of a bar in downtown Nashville. \u00a0Looks good in the low light, seems nice when you can't hear what she is saying, has a nice smile. \u00a0Once the harsh light of day hits however you realize that the looks are three inches makeup, the voice is broken glass, and the smile is actually urinal yellow. \u00a0Maybe that is why it was filled with Ice.", "Date": "2011-09-02", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "Z K.", "ReviewID": "NEkhLeEcUCUUoY5T4SalFw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, this place is nothing less that awesome!

There's something you should know about me. I hate waiting in lines. I know that most restaurants don't actually make you wait in line, at least not in the way they did in grade school, where I was initially set upon the path of hating to queue. Nonetheless, if I walk into a restaurant because I am hungry, I want to be able to eat now, or at least be seated and able to place my order. I know this is \"unreasonable\" to some, but, if I am told there is a thirty minute or hour long wait for a table, my mind immediately begins to calculate the driving time to other nearby restaurants where the wait may not be as long. But, I digress...One of the main reasons I love Past Perfect is that no matter what event is happening or whatever time of day, you can usually sit down at a table immediately; I've never personally experienced a wait longer than five minutes. Sure, a couple of times we had to eat at the bar because the restaurant was woefully understaffed, but even while understaffed the bartender provided excellent service and our food was served quickly. Oh, I nearly forgot the food. They have an eclectic assortment of items on the menu; I'd worked my way about halfway down the burger list when one night I decided to listen to my wife's suggestion and try the meatloaf with spaghetti. I know, I know --meatloaf with spaghetti? Don't knock it until you've tried it, ladies and gents. The meatloaf is subtly spicy and incorporates a blend of fresh herbs that I have nearly completely identified and been able to replicate at home. The pasta is always al dente and the dish is covered in Parmesan. I'm nearly salivating just thinking about it as I type. The drinks are yet another reason to come. They have a great deal of liquor infusions with ingredients more varied than you can imagine.

They make all their burgers with Bison, which is incredibly lean but so tasty. The burger is topped with two types of cheese, two friend eggs, tomato, bacon, and Horseradish Mayo. It was delicious.

When you walk in the door, the speakeasy theme hits you right away. It's not as upscale or trendy as other cocktail taverns in town (ahem, Patterson House), but that means you pay less for food and drink that comes close in quality. The house-infused vodka selection is immense, and their classic cocktail list has some interesting options. The menu is upscale pub food, with great bison burgers, several salads and pasta options. Their \"Specialties\" menu selections have some great takes on meatloaf, Hawaiian moco and seared tuna plates.My best experiences have been at brunch on a Saturday or Sunday. The Perfect Steak Benedict is an excellent take on Eggs Benedict, and I found the presentation to be better than your typical Nashville brunch spot. The Bloody Mary bar was also a great pick - simply choose a vodka flavor base (I recommend the cucumber) and add your favorite mixes and garnishments.

That said, it's always these types of places that have good food and drink, and good service considering the number of patrons who walk in.A colleague and I walked in a little before 8p during the week for dinner. When you walk in, there's a lot going on. \"Confusing\" is not the word I would use, but you do have to do a double-take. A framed picture of Abraham Lincoln (if memory serves) and a large-screen cabin television showing old short/silent movies can be found in the dining room, along with high-definition TVs showing sports.

Yes, cans. Pabst Blue Ribbon and Old Style, to be exact. This is the first bar outside of Chicago where I've seen these two served, so that hipster style points (though I later learned that they were out of the latter).

I opted for a 5oz. flat-iron open-faced sandwich (also available in 10oz), while my colleague went with the beef tips. The portion size was surprisingly big, at least as far as the steak tips were concerned.Then we ordered dessert. We had our chance to have separate desserts, but our collective guilt forced us to select only one: The Derby Pie, a tub of pecan pie with brownies and wedges of vanilla ice cream, drizzled with chocolate syrup.

Don't let the name scare you, (it was my first one, too) but it was juicy and toppings (especially the blue cheese & gorgonzola sauce) really compliment the meat. The only side option (aside of paying extra for a salad) is kettle chips. Out of a bag. If you're feeling indulgent, another good dinner option is the gorgonzola chicken pasta. There are a few salad & wrap options if you're looking for something a little more health-minded, but I doubt there's anything on the menu that's uber healthy. The restaurant infuses its own vodka, and being a vodka girl, that makes me happy. My first experience went something like this me: \"can you suggest a flavor?\" bartender: \"bubble gum\" me: *blank stare* \"really?\" *long pause* \"ok.\" But I'm actually glad I went with the recommendation! It tasted exactly like bubble gum without being overwhelming. I suppose the point of my story is this: there are like 100 (ok, maybe 20) flavors so think outside the box.Service/Atmosphere: I've never had to wait for a table and the service is decent. It's hasn't ever taken a super long time to get food, but it isn't especially quick either. As far as atmosphere, it's right off lower Broad but it does do a fairly good job at distancing itself from the honky tonks. It's very exposed-brick-narrow-alley-ish-rustic but I think it kind of works with the menu. Cost: Bison burgers are $12 (which I'll admit is pricy for a burger) and infused vodka drinks I estimate to be about $6.

Perhaps that in and of itself tells you (almost) everything you need to know.In my mind, the best thing Past Perfect does is offer \"Geeks Who Drink\" trivia night on Wednesdays which is super fun and always guarantees that laughs, along with liquor, will flow. If not for this event, I might never have wandered into this establishment, because truth be told, the downtown Nashville area is not my usual stomping grounds. But my love of displaying my abundance of random and often irrelevant knowledge needs occasional showcasing and that is when Past Perfect comes to the rescue. Although the event doesn't start until 8, if you can wait that long, you can get a plate of spaghetti, salad and bread for just $5, which isn't too shabby. (I should mention that the dinner special is available all day... my husband and I just don't turn up until 8 for the trivia!) The thing is, my husband and I never can wait, so we always end up imbibing heavily instead and then ordering various appetizers in a frantic attempt to soak up the alcohol in our system before we try to get home. Based on this, I can say that their spinach-artichoke dip has a really nice zing, and is best eaten with the grilled pita bread.The big downside for me about PP is twofold: First, the service generally isn't great. Often you can go ages without seeing your waitstaff and will have to engage in something akin to Olympics level rhythmic dancing to flag them down. Even though this place seems like more of a bar than a restaurant to me, they always seem slightly perturbed when you indicate you only want to order drinks. Additionally (and secondly), said drinks just aren't really that impressive in my mind. Much has been made of their touted homemade infusions, but I think a bottle of flavored Smirnoff is just as tasty. I had a cucumber vodka & soda and it was fine, but I didn't feel compelled to order another one. And the other mixed drinks I've ordered have had mixed success. You aren't much safer with beer either, unfortunately. One super annoying thing about PP is that they don't list prices for their drinks, so it's kind of a crapshoot about how much you're going to get charged. We found out the hard way that while two small beers = 1 large beer in terms of volume, the actual price is cheaper to order two small bears rather than the 1 large beer! Maybe this was a pricing error, but everyone at our table was shocked by this.This is one of those places that I want to like more than I do. The atmosphere is cool (they have a suit of armor), and the food I've had has been pretty yummy.

Both of those were a plus, but other things, not so good. Street parking is hard to find, and parking garages are expensive. We unknowingly came on trivia night, which would have been fine if we wanted to play trivia. But we wanted to just hang out and talk, so the trivia was sort of distracting. There were only a few other people there, maybe 2-3 tables playing trivia. Not a lot of activity. I got the smokehouse bison burger and wanted it to be delicious. But the meat was dry and there was not nearly enough cheese- couldn't taste it. So the burger was overall not too flavorful. The pasta salad was fine, though. The portions were well-sized, just enough food. The desserts are overly sweet. The drink menu was very large, they can basically make whatever you would like. This is a good place to come out for drinks, maybe not for dinner, and check the calendars before you come out.", "Date": "2011-07-16", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "Kristin G.", "ReviewID": "O_DB-yc7JtnX7C2lnFKIuQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been on the fence about PP for awhile now. \u00a0I love martinis, A LOT. \u00a0So I was excited when we went and they were known for their martinis. \u00a0Well, I ordered and I sent it back. \u00a0It tasted terrible. \u00a0The bartender made another and I ended up pouring it out in the bathroom. \u00a0Maybe it was a bad night. \u00a0So you think that would be enough for me but I found myself back for trivia. \u00a0First off, I like how they do trivia much better than the turn in your answer after every question. \u00a0So annoying!! \u00a0I'm here to play trivia and drink, not to get in a mini workout too. \u00a0Then my friend ordered a bison burger with a fried egg on top. \u00a0I was salivating, I love fried eggs, seriously, it makes everything better, just like bacon. \u00a0Plus I ordered a beer and it's impossible to screw that up. \u00a0So I was pulled back over into the kind of liking it again. \u00a0It is convenient when you are walking to a Preds game from the east side. \u00a0So there you have it, the most wishy-washy review ever.", "Date": "2011-10-17", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "Peter M.", "ReviewID": "oK7ku0AOjVos8L774SSd3A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm really torn about this place. \u00a0I appreciate it as a bar. \u00a0It's dark and well-appointed and feels a little bit like a neighborhood bar in a fancy big-city neighborhood. \u00a0It is downtown and provides a nice oasis when I am stuck down there for some stupid party and need to escape the tourists and honky-tonks. \u00a0However, the food is truly horrible. \u00a0Once ordered a burger which was bland, over cooked, and on a flavorless, small stale roll. \u00a0I've tried it more than once and once had out of town guests and was very embarassed.", "Date": "2007-03-22", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "Melissa M.", "ReviewID": "OjdiWBNY99nTvnGnhhihyA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had a delicious bloody mary with cucumber infused vodka, the bartender could tailor it however I wanted.", "Date": "2012-08-27", "Author_Location": "Raleigh, NC"}, {"Author": "Sherry O.", "ReviewID": "4eHqx0tF4WvTJZ7YBd4X-w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently moved to Downtown Nashville and had a chance to have dinner at Past Perfect with my sister. \u00a0We had a great expereince and good food. \u00a0The bison burger was great as was the grilled flatiron steak sandwich. \u00a0My sister had the pasta salad. \u00a0It was good but had too many onions for her taste and mine. \u00a0We had great service from our server Lita. \u00a0I look forward to returning many times and next time trying the infused vodkas.", "Date": "2011-08-21", "Author_Location": "Nashville, TN"}, {"Author": "lm m.", "ReviewID": "qK33OIiiPTuh18dvVRqOZQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Service is always slow even if there is only a couple patrons. \u00a0It's disgusting to think the waiters and cooks are touching the food because you will always find them out front smoking. \u00a0I've actually had food that tasted like smoke. \u00a0ICK! \u00a0Wouldn't recommend this place at all.", "Date": "2011-03-31", "Author_Location": "Clarksville, TN"}], "RestaurantInfo": {"RestaurantID": "5HHr_3pCw6TQEFOJD6UmfA", "Name": "Past Perfect", "Price": "$$", "RestaurantURL": "/biz/past-perfect-nashville", "Longitude": " -86.77546890000000", "Address": "122 3rd Ave SNashville, TN 37201", "Latitude": " 36.160787300000003", "ImgURL": "//s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r4WJYlktPFcupZiq73NpEw/90s.jpg"}}
