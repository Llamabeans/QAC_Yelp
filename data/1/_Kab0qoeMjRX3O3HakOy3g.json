I hate having to drink tons of water after eating a meal because the msg.

Maybe because I was with a bunch of friends I didn't notice how horrible this restaurant really is. The second time I visited, while we were waiting for our food, the waitress was sitting at one of the tables CLIPPING HER NAILS....it was disgusting. Let's just say I lost my appetite. Today, I decided to give them another chance, I was craving Thai food...so I ordered take out. When I got home there was a small roach in my soup! I should have stuck with my instinct and gone to eat at a different restaurant.

The food was just okay, but the service sucked.We ordered tom yum pineapple soup, \u00a0stuffed chicken wings & a spicy seafood dish with a small order of rice. When we walked in the waitress didn't bother to say hi, or anything, just placed two menus in front of us didn't ask us if we had any questions, & took about 20 minutes to take our order. Definitely felt like we got cold shoulder from the waitress and set for a poor dining experience. On to the food: the chicken wings were HUGE had a nice crunch to them on the outside, but not enough flavor on the inside with the stuffing. Just some carrots and cabbage. The soup was good and probably had the most flavor. And the spicy seafood dish was also juat okay, I wasn't \"wowed\" by it.I'd like to go back and perhaps try something different, \u00a0but not with that kind of service.", "Date": "2014-04-27", "Author_Location": "Honolulu, HI"}, {"Author": "darrin k.", "ReviewID": "oTte-MPlvOfEX7UW8zQAlw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First time in the restaurant.

Nicely stuffed and flavored, a great start to the meal.Then came the pad thai, ordered with chicken. I thought it was seasoned perfectly - not too sweet...not too rancid...but jus' right, ya! We finished this dish clean.Last was the curry. I forget exactly which one we ordered but again, very tasty. We asked for medium though and I think there was a mistake cuz it was a lot spicier than I thought it would be. Good reason to polish off the beers!

Unlike other tourists, we wanted to get away from Honolulu/Wakiki Beach and the touristy spots to try some local places and experience the Oahu lifestyle on a much more personal level. Being a tourist can be a little fake, so we jumped on Yelp in search of an authentic Thai restaurant outside of the immediate city. We tried Thai Herb Kitchen first, but they were closed on Sunday (Honolulu Festival day, go figure). We said to each other, \"Whatevs, let's find another place.\" That's when we came across Thai Issan Cuisine. \u00a0This place had some amazing reviews, so we decided to go with it and give it a shot. Well, I can guarantee that the reviews don't lie, THIS PLACE IS FREAKING AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It has a local \u00a0or a \"small hole in the wall\" atmosphere; from the moment I stepped into this place, I was smacked with wonderful smells, friendly personalities, and bustling energy. My boyfriend and I took a seat and had a waitress help us out in a prompt fashion. Within 10 minutes of ordering, we got our food. OMG IT WAS SOOOO GOOD. We ordered Drunken Noodles and a Curry dish. We ate everything and enjoyed every bite. The food was satisfying, didn't leave me with an upset stomach or anything. Flavors were delicious. The only thing that bothered us AT FIRST- BUT WAS IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED- \u00a0was the food not being spicy enough. My boyfriend and I are Thai Food connoisseurs, and we love SPICE. Most Thai food restaurant owners don't understand this, and when my boyfriend orders \"super Thai hot x10,\" most of the time no one believes his request and they don't make it that hot. There is good reason, no offense to anyone, but the normal White American person does NOT know a thing about Thai food, and cannot handle Thai spice. Most restaurant owners expect this level of ignorance, and I can't blame them for assuming that. Well, that is not the case with us. When we got our food and we noticed it wasn't hot enough, we talked to the waitress. My boyfriend and I explained to the waitress that we were crazy Americans who could handle Thai hot. She was ecstatic to hear this, hopped away, and told another waitress to bring us chili peppers. The other waitress brought us dried flakes and set it at our table. Our original waitress came back, tsk-tsked, and called the other waitress over and told her to bring us REAL chili peppers. They came back with REAL freshly cut Thai chilis. My boyfriend and I started eating them raw, then we put some in our food and continued to eat. OMG it was HEAVEN!! We were so happy, and they were so accommodating. This was the first time in FOREVER that someone took us seriously. I loved the way they treated us here. We have gone to other Thai places and have asked for Thai hot, they fail to deliver and don't even offer solutions. There has been so many times people don't take our requests seriously, and it is mildly offensive. The people at Thai Issan were awesome, helpful, and offered us FRESH peppers. \u00a0 We talked to the owner, she was a lovely older woman with a warm personality. Totally a family owned place. Get out of the drone mentality, step out of the tourist comfort zone, drive a little out and GO HERE, it is TOTALLY WORTH IT! :-D If you love Thai food, get your butt over there NOW. If you are a legit Thai food lover and love THAI hot spice, go here, let them know, and they WILL make it hot like the fires of HADES!! woohoo!! Lastly, heat isn't the only thing that matters in making Thai food, it's favors, textures , etc. Keeping all of this in mind, their food is awesome.

The name on the menu didnt match the name of the restaurant, and seeing as the server didnt know any of the numbers in the menu, my guess is they boosted the menus from some other thai restaurant!", "Date": "2013-09-12", "Author_Location": "Honolulu, HI"}, {"Author": "Anthony P.", "ReviewID": "2FklmVCUp-78q4__1Y0XIw", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't understand why this restaurant receives decent reviews.

The empty dinning room allured us to buy something for lunch to help support the new business in the area. First experience: the food was awesome. We ordered take out \"lunch special of the day\".. Includes 2 pieces of fried chicken, a hefty salad, choice of curry, \u00a0rice or sticky rice and 1 canned drink. The portion fed the both of us well and left us stuffed. Good first experience. Then we went again and again few more times soon after. Now today, 2013. the restaurant gained momentum and had quite a few dine in customers during lunch. Looks like business is going well. After my take out experience today.. Well you ain't seeing me Here again..heck NO! So, I got the take out order for the \"lunch special\" again. From past experiences, I expected the same portions. BUT THIS TIME, the 2 pieces of fried chicken turned out to be, \"1/2 piece\". They gave me FRIED CHICKEN \"SKIN\" and a piece of BONE WITH SOME MEAT on it...WHAT THE HELL!! I know I didn't come here to spend $10.00 for that! The salad was down sized, and the green curry was just okay, Not great. I also ordred a side sticky rice. The lady who took my order, scooped the sticky rice into the container, then used her bare hands in front of us to stove the rice into the container to force close it... Yea yea.. i know, many places do that, behind closed doors.. but not in front of the paying customer! thats really gross. its gross because she first took my payment, then immediately made the sticky rice. She did'nt wash her hands or anything. Well anyways. i guess she was having a bad day or something because it seemed like she didnt care for my business.. or money..TIP: Don't order the lunch special for take out! Because you'll be surprised when opening up that container. Not worth $10.00Such a waste of my money.. BTW.. as u stream thru the photos, you'll see the chicken skin picture.", "Date": "2013-02-12", "Author_Location": "Ewa Beach, HI"}, {"Author": "Lynn T.", "ReviewID": "1pA-tthA_oJM5TYfA0HChg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thai House's owners recently changed the restaurant's name to Thai Issan Cuisine. Same chefs and same good food. My experience at this place has been nothing short of spectacular. It's not fair to judge the food on whether or not the place looks busy. Unfortunately, I have to agree that business is quite slow, but that's how my love affair with Thai Issan Cuisine began. The first time I decided to try it out, there was only one person eating there. To be honest, I was a bit worried about the food, but I was in a rush and was hoping if there wasn't anyone else to feed, they'd work quickly for me. What a pleasant surprise! I haven't enjoyed another Thai restaurant as much since. After this place proved me wrong and impressed me so much, I'll be thinking twice before I turn my back on a restaurant for not being busy - because that does NOT mean the food is bad. It could just mean people are misinformed, may even be afraid to try something out of the norm, and/or \u00a0Thai Issan Cuisine chefs had an off day (we've all had those). This is authentic Thai food, people. Also, it's likely that the more traditional dishes may be different than what you're used to. I find a lot of Thai restaurants have gone local. Not here. And if you ask for hot, you'll be crying.. AND smiling at the same time. They don't mess around. \u00a0What's also different is they do not do plate lunches like everyone else. However, that is not a problem for me because I love to try a variety of things all at once and I have yet to come across a plate lunch big enough to fit everything I could possibly want to satisfy the foodie in me. They have daily specials which include rice, different curries, and fried chicken though. So yes, you'd normally have to order rice (available sticky or regular) separately if you're not getting the special. The prices stay true to the other Thai restaurants I've gone to. Not incredibly cheap, but not ridiculously expensive. The portions and quality is just right for the price. I have never felt cheated here. At Thai Issan Cuisine, the food gets to you quickly, servers regularly check up on you for water or just to see how you're doing, and always asks how you want the dish (mild, medium, or spicy) when taking your order. You can have almost everything spicy or not as long as you make sure to say so.I have my favorites here and have never been disappointed by the:- Pad See Ew (had it in chicken and beef - loved both)- House Fried Chicken (LOVE this)- Stuffed Chicken Wings (had a lot of different stuffed wings in my day - best so far)- Larb (beef is what I usually get, but pork is just as enjoyable)- Green Papaya Salad (Lao style is VERY spicy; more so than Vietnamese style)- Tom Yum (had the tofu version - winner)- Green curry with chicken (I put this in general terms because their curries are just awesome)- Spicy clams (the sauce is made of Heaven - drizzled it on other dishes because I just couldn't get enough)Don't write this place off!
