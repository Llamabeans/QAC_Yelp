After trying the crispy noodle I have come to the conclusion that I have to try out their pan fried noodle because I believe that they just be the same thing but I'm hazarding a guess that it's in the actual noodles themselves that are the difference.

The meat here is hung in the window like those in china do it. Its flavors are REALLY succulent and juicy. I recommend it to anyone who comes here. I also recommend the fried rice. This is something else. I have eaten it all my life, and up till this day, i still love it nonetheless. Its cooked with eggs, peas, carrots, bbq pork, and shrimp (along with some other herbs). The mix of flavor that they have here really brings out the inner flavor of the rice itself and i LOVE it. The last thing is the Spicy sauce they have here. For some reason, \u00a0i would be fully content with just coming here and eating the sate sauce with rice. Its got this peanut-like flavor/ texture that i can't seem to figure out.

There were 2 good looking Asian Girls wearing the shortest Mini Skirts that Ive ever seen , 3 Asian Guys wearing FUBU gear with their pants almost around their knees with their Boxers Showing , Some guys wearing full Camo and 1 Elderly Asian guy that looked like Flavor Flav. What a cast of Characters. The Waiter Dropped me off a Pot of Tea and a Pot of Steamed Rice which I like . They don't try to Nickel and Dime you with little bowls. Then the Waiter brought me the Biggest Calderon of Seafood that Ive seen on top of a Sterno Burner. I'm in Heaven. The Seafood Hot Pot had Shrimp ,Scallops ,Squid ,Bock Choy, Broccoli, Black Mushrooms ,Garlic , Fish Fillets and Baby Corn on the Cob in a Savory Gravy. It was Delish .

They make it so crispy and good. We also ordered their house special wet chow fun and their salty fish and chicken fried rice which both turned out good. They were also very fast, our food came out within 5 minutes after we ordered.. Maybe it was because there were only 3 other parties besides us. But Ive noticed that this place gets pretty busy during the weekends cause I usually go hello dessert which is right next door to this restaurant. The prices here are pretty reasonable, my only complaint would be that once again it's those typical CASH ONLY restaurant.

Anyway, so we came in and were surprised at how much more space they have available in the back for dine in customers. We dined in, and were seated promptly by a very kind asian man. They gave us a lot of time to look over the menu, which I appreciated because they have such a wide variety of selections! We finally ordered the pork chow mein, with the sizzling beef plate with a side of rice (which they didn't charge us for!). They give you free Jasmine tea at the beginning of your meal to have throughout the meal. Our food came out in a timely fashion and was delish! I loved the sizzling beef plate because it was semi spicy with lots of sauce, and not TOO oily like most Chinese food tends to be, The prices are reasonable and I enjoyed eating there. The place looks a little run down, but most of the things there seemed pretty clean to me. The chow mein was a bit on the bland side, but it still tasted mighty delicious!
