Granted, we were there past peak hours (close to 8:45 pm) but the restaurant was still probably about 80% capacity and quite busy.The portions of sushi, while not voluminous, were generous and delicious.

My husband and I both got the first set: chirashi: 5 pieces of sashimi and a tamagoyaki (Japanese omelette) over rice. tempura: 2 pieces of shrimp and 1 broccoli over rice. cold soba noodleschawanmushi (steamed egg)miso soupAll come in small portions and its a perfect combination for a day when you want to just have some varieties of Japanese food at once. The sashimi from the chirashi is pretty warm and tasted like pre-cut, which I was pretty surprised. Tamagoyaki was really good and well-done ( which is very difficult to make and I am sure they have a skilled team in the kitchen). Tempura was fried quite fair, but the sauce was already added-on ( have never seen this before), and if you don't eat it soon enough, they become soggy. Soba noodles came in the sauce (which looks more like a cold soba noodles soup) and covered by freshly cut big green onion slices. The flavor of the soup, green onions and seaweeds all together made it a satisfying dish. Chawanmushi is flavorful and silky, and miso soup is \u00a0pretty authentic. As this price, we both were very happy with it. Also, this is a place obviously not one for children. it's small and during lunch time it is just packed with people work in the area. We brought our toddler and she was asleep in the stroller.

At least, that's what I've been telling myself for the past two weeks since my boyfriend and I had a fairly underwhelming meal at this place on Saturday 12/28/13. Where should I start? Well, for one thing, even though the restaurant wasn't crowded when we sat down, it took a very long time for our waitress to appear, and progressively longer intervals passed as we waited for drinks, appetizers, entrees, etc. I also noted that it seemed there were only about 3 servers working the tables. Couldn't find people willing to work over a holiday weekend, Wajima?Anyway, back to the food. I decided to order \u00a0the crab with seaweed appetizer (can't recall the name of the dish), and when it came out (after roughly 20 tedious minutes), I was disappointed. Five little dollops of imitation crab meat over a bed of wilted seaweed. It's a good thing I was starving and had some wasabi to give them a hint of flavor. The sushi entree....hm. Not horrible, but definitely nothing special: three tiny rolls filled with spicy salmon, tuna, and yellowtail (at least I think that's what they were made of, they all tasted the same) and smeared with globs of spicy mayo. My boyfriend got the Shabu Shabu and wasn't thrilled with it, but it was good enough to prevent hunger pains. There were a few highlights interspersed throughout the meal: I enjoyed the sake, and their green tea was also good. I also thought the hostess was nice to offer us a space to place our heavy shopping bags so they wouldn't get in our way at the table.

My fiance, his aunt, and I arrived at 12PM. There were only about 3 occupied tables at that time and we had no trouble being seated. By 12:15 when we placed our order however, the place was full house. There were parties gathering around the front entrance waiting for a table to become available. So glad we came right before the lunch rush! They have the regular lunch menu available but it was a no brainer for us to go with the lunch specials. They have 3 choices and we decided to order one of each. They didn't have tuna sashimi rice bowl that day so they asked if we are okay with salmon sashimi instead - sounds perfect to me. The food came relatively fast and everything tasted spot on. The shrimp temperas were nicely breaded with perfect crunch and seasoning. The sashimi were really fresh. The cold soba noodle was extremely refreshing! The steamed egg had a nice kick of ginger. The miso soup was a little bit too salty but still delicious. An amazing lunch set all for $11. My fiance had the sukiyaki beef + tofu and hot soba noodle set. He said he wasn't blown away by the soba noodle but still very satisfied. His aunt's lunch set basically had everything in mine except hers didn't come with soba noodle and it was an all salmon bowl - she also was extremely happy with hers.

I give it 4 to 5 stars for decor. But I have to say as far as value and quality (based on the sushi and the tempura), I prefer Ginza which is not a hole in the wall with ugly walls by any means. It's definitely better looking, though, with a lot more space between tables. The cold sake list is quite good and I had two individual servings of the Sakawone (sp, I didn't write it down). The miso is particularly good and I came down with a bug in New Jersey this weekend so that was comforting. My friend and I were perplexed as to why we were brought hot tea halfway through the meal (between appetizer and entree) and he thought it was quite bizarre that he would be served tea in the middle of his beer. I would not come here by myself or choose to come here with a dining companion again when Ginza is around the corner but it is a nice place with good though not great sushi. (Really, the salmon, tuna, yellowtail don't hold a candle to Ginza though Ikura was good).I'm sure I would think it a 3 or 4 star if I tried the lunch special everyone is talking about but since Ginza has THE most amazing Bento box which includes soup, salad, two baby shu mai dumplings, I don't know why I would try it. Friend called me and said, \"We won't be going there again. It had all the charm of a washboard.\" Actually, the ambiance was the ONE 5 star part of this. It's not a normal sushi joint but Ginza is pretty cute with the wood walls. I admit I love sukiyaki and might try that but given I have had various appetizers and cooked food at Ginza and been happy always, I doubt I would give it a try here.One last note: my friend ordered sushi not in a combination but individually. He eats sushi rarely and only likes a few kinds of fish. He is a foodie and Manhattanite of 30 plus years for whom food was central part of life and work and he thought it was \"quite expensive.\" I explained that of course it was, as he ordered individual nigiri at night.

What you can't tell on Yelp is that the prices are way jacked up for a Japanese restaurant \u00a0- you're looking at spending at least $30/person (the high end of $$ or low end of $$$). It might be because it's near such a large tourist shopping area or because it's surrounded by lots of overpriced \"fusion Asian\" or kitschy ethnic places that can get away with overcharging their customers. I'm sure this place is great if you're willing to shell out extra for Japanese food, but I wouldn't come here for a regular evening meal.Besides that, the place was full, a crowd of mixed tourists and Asians, the waitstaff all Japanese, and the decor kind of bland and brightly lit.My friend and I ended up going around the corner to Ginza Japanese Restaurant, which had lower prices (~$15-18/person).

For the price, they serve really authentic, fresh, honestly good food. I can't say it enough. No, I'm not their family or an employee; I'm just a Japanese girl who knows her food when it's awesome!I had Sashimi dinner combo.Holy crap! The sashimi was SUPER FRESH \u00a0and the salmon melted in my mouth. I was speechless so my husband got worried. I told him to try the salmon and he was speechless, too! If you like sashimi, this is a must-order. In addition to the main entree, the combo came with 2 Japanese appetizers, miso soup, rice, pickles, and ice cream at the end. It was very filling and it was only $25 or so. My husband ordered the Tempura dinner combo. I remember seeing 3 or 4 shrimps plus 6-7 vegetables. I ate his egg plant tempura and it was wonderful. Warm and juicy. The thin tempura batter really accentuated the flavor of the veggie. Like my combo, his came with the other combo sides as well.At the end of the dish, I was fully satisfied and wanted to try everything on the menu. I'll be back for certain. For a New York restaurant, I thought the interior was spacious. This was great because we don't have to listen to other people's conversations and there are plenty of space around the table.", "Date": "2012-08-11", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "dice-K S.", "ReviewID": "yVqidx1-msyL3-YopVs0eg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been here a few times..It's a great neighborhood Japanese Restaurant with authentic Japanese food taste. looking at the menu they also have a decent size Sake selection.

No people at all. But... we still decided to give it a whirl.I was planning on getting the sushi sashimi dinner for $25, but they wouldnt make ANY substitutions .... I actually dont like to see such inflexibility in restaurants... The waitress was also short and \u00a0combined with the latter, I knocked a star off for customer service.The food was decent, not expensive and not inexpensive. We ordered a roll and sashimi. The fish seemed fresh, but they made it in the kitchen, no sushi bar, which was unusual. I was pleasantly surprised that they bring you complimentary tea at the end of your meal. This is becasue the whole night the restaurant gave me the \"stingy\" vibe. So overall, I woudlnt go back.
