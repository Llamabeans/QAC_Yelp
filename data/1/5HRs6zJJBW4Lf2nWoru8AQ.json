I realize the irony there. I've had A LOT of Mexican food in my life...some good and some not so good but this really wasn't bad. I had the taquitos which are pretty hard to screw up but they were good, as was the guac and sour cream on the side. We split a pitcher of mango margaritas which were really good too. The staff were all very friendly too. My only complaint would be the price. For what you get, it's just not worth the $10 - $15 average price for everything. But you're in Hawaii, so you have to expect to pay a little more for stuff.Bottom line, if you have a hankering for Mexican food when you're visiting Oahu, this would overall be a good place to start.", "Date": "2014-05-09", "Author_Location": "Orange, CA"}, {"Author": "Dr. L.", "ReviewID": "RkfEBUGFoJ7dJdoQ73fpUQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's ,Cinco de Mayo, as an avid and lover of Mexican food, I EXPECT Mexican restaurants to be busy. \u00a0But at the same time, if you're a restaurant owner or manager, YOU SHOULD know that on holidays like Cinco de Mayo, you should be prepared! \u00a0And I speak as a former server in the restaurant business. \u00a0The funny thing was, my friend and I didn't even get there at pique dinner time hours. \u00a0We got there about 8:30 pm, there was a wait for a table - even though there were at least 6 tables open. \u00a0The hostess and wait staff looked so over whelmed, \u00a0to a restaurant that wasn't even fully seated to capacity!. \u00a0There was a bit of a line at the bar, which my friend and I went to, to go get drinks...again, the bartenders - I would say there was two but, really they were working like there was only one and a half people behind the bar, it was if the bar was packed into the dining room, when there was really only 4 of us in line and the restaurant still not fully seated. \u00a0I was so tempted not to just jump over and pick up our Dos Equis and pop the caps off. \u00a0Plus - what Mexican restaurant/bar doesn't have Cinco de Mayo specials on Cinco de Mayo? \u00a0You take your normal \"Mexican Beer specials\" off the table because it's Cinco de Mayo??? \u00a0You should be keeping those specials up and doing dollar tacos like the rest of the world!While we finally got seated, maybe waiting about 15-20 minutes, our server while nice, took forever to get to us. \u00a0I had to wave down the hostess to ask where our server was after waiting 10 minutes, not even to be greeted \u00a0I asked to start off with chips and guacamole and she did forewarn us to order our second round of beers now even though we still had half way to go because she admittedly said, it will take forever. \u00a0She brought the chips and salsa, but no guacamole. \u00a0I didn't bother her about it until half way through the chips and asked her, \"We did order guacamole, right? \u00a0It's coming?\" \u00a0She smiled as if either a) she forgot to put the order in or b)she was giving me the look of \"Look biatch, I'm slammed and I can't get your freakin' guacamole!\" \u00a0But she simply said, \"it's coming\"An empty basket of chips and still no guacamole, we get our second round of drinks. \u00a0Luckily my friend and I were having a good time that we didn't notice that our meal was taking forever to arrive - the other friends we ran into said it was going to take 45 minutes from the moment we sat down - and they were right. \u00a0And sure enough, we got our guacamole with our meal, not as an appetizer as we requested. \u00a0I mean don't you have guacamole in the back in buckets - why did it take 45 minutes to get literally a small bowl of guacamole? \u00a0That should have come out when the chips and salsa came out. \u00a0As I watched our server - I thought how inefficient she was because she was literally catering to a table one at a time, when the simple things she could have grabbed or taken care of, could have been done all at the same time.For example, when she dropped off our dinner she asked if she could get anything else, so I asked her for some Tapatio, Diet Coke and another beer. \u00a0I can't eat my dinner without the hot sauce. \u00a0All she needed to do was grab a bottle - especially since she walked past our table 4 different times, and not once did she drop off a bottle of Tapatio. \u00a0Ten minutes of waiting, I couldn't wait any longer because my food was already getting cold and my friend was almost finished with his dinner - I went up to the hostess and asked for a bottle of Didn't take her more than a minute to grab. \u00a0The sad thing was, our server didn't even have a full section - she had four 4 tops at the most and it was no longer busy, the restaurant was winding down - it was almost 10 pm!When our server finally came to check on how our food was, we asked, \"So, is our drinks coming, our diet coke and beer?\" \u00a0Do you know what she did, she smiled sheepishly and said, \"Yeah...\" as if to say, \"Yeah...about that...\" \u00a0So I had to clarify, \"Yeah are they coming or yeah I forgot to put the order in?\"She then went to check on them and even 10 minutes later still with no drinks, the hostess came by to ask us how we were doing and I said, \"you seem to be able to get things faster than our server. \u00a0I know she's checking on our drinks, but the bar isn't even slammed - there's barely anyone in here - how hard is it to get a diet coke and pop off the cap of a corona?\"After the hostess left, 2 minutes later our server brought us our drinks. \u00a0Luckily, when she brought us our tab, she took off those last two drinks because of our long wait. \u00a0And while the food was good - it was certainly not worth the weight - I am from San Diego and I know what great Mexican food is and how restaurants do it for Cinco de Mayo - this was my worst experience EVER for Cinco de Mayo. \u00a0We didn't leave there until 10:30 pm!!", "Date": "2014-05-06", "Author_Location": "Honolulu, HI"}, {"Author": "Manya V.", "ReviewID": "zO43I0iZ6xCO32--h-uBVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Favorite Mexican restaurant.

Our food was clearly all microwaved (The Jalape\u00f1o Nachos were a prime example.) I wanted to eat out so I wouldn't have to eat my own garbage cooking at home yet these nachos were something I could have made! More proof that this food was microwaved was the fact that I pulled off all the cheese on my nachos with one hand and just had a whole bunch of burnt chips underneath. (When it says Jalape\u00f1os and Cheese on the menu that's literally ALL that was on these chips.) The service was slow, our waitress was clueless and EVERYTHING was overpriced. I ate with 3 other people and we all got ripped off big time.

Sure, its not the same as some Mexican food options in San Diego or Los Angeles, but definitely one of my top choices here in the islands. And they have a great many choices of margarita flavors, beers and other festive drinks. This time I had one of their specials - chicken enchiladas with green verde sauce, rice and beans. YUM! I hope they make this a regular option, because I'm a big fan of green sauce. My friend tried the banana margarita - which at first sounded funky, but after I stole a sip, I realize it works!!

I should have went with my first instinct to leave before I was even seated but I guess I am a glutton for punishment. The place has the ambiance of a old, stale, sticky dive bar. I ordered the New Mexican Burrito which was described in the menu as: Stewed beef cooked with mild green chilies, wrapped in a flour tortilla, covered red Chile sauce and melted cheese. Served with sour cream.\"The price for this burrito with beans and rice was somewhere around $15 bucks. What I received was a flour tortilla FULL of onions and peppers covered in a red chili sauce. My first bite was OK, but I noticed as I went for the second bite that there seemed to be a generous amount of onions ( and BY generous I mean ALL of the onions in the entire establishment) In attempt to find the beef that was supposed to be in my burrito sliced the burrito long ways down the center. What I found was 5 pieces of meat that were each the size of a dime....NO EXAGGERATION! After removing all of the onions and peppers from my burrito, I was left with nothing more than a flour tortilla covered in red chili sauce. My order was a \"to go\" order so I had already left and was home before I discovered the quality of the food and even though I was starving, I could not let this go. I got back in my car drove back to Jose's circled the parking lot a half a dozen times to find a parking spot and went back to return my food. There was no manager on duty just a waitress who was the \"acting manager.\" \u00a0She didn't even ask me if she could fix the problem or replace the meal. She gladly gave me my money back for my entire order (including the quesadilla that my friend ordered that was FAR LESS than spectacular) She wasn't able to credit my card back because she wasn't a \"manager\" but she did refund me in cash........Cash that I took to another Mexican place around the corner and spent half as much for 100% better food.", "Date": "2014-02-01", "Author_Location": "Honolulu, HI"}, {"Author": "James G.", "ReviewID": "qOMV5omEyWpw5zTGtJBbhg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I don't know why I haven't learned my lesson.

I am not certain if it was due to the alcohol because her table coverage exceeded 5 and she was not panicking. Food: Free Chips and Salsa: So after your first set, you have to pay for additional. \u00a0What? \u00a0Matt was irate because in a real \"Mexican Restaurant\" they never make you pay extra. \u00a0This is a new economy dear, and that is how life is now. \u00a0However, in our situation, free, free, free. \u00a0The salsa was spicy and delicious. \u00a0Even Matt complimented it nicely, even comparing the taste to his mom's salsa. \u00a05/5Soup (Abondigas): Rice and meatballs together. \u00a0I never thought this combination would be anything special, but it was delightful. \u00a0In your mouth it went from a lightness from the soup to softness from the vegetables and then ending with a heavy beefiness from the balls. \u00a0The combinations and layers of texture and flavor was awesome. Mmm...yum. \u00a0After Matt said he was done with it, I smiled and scarfed it down for myself. \u00a0However, it seemed like something was missing. \u00a0An ingredient: spice, acidity? \u00a0Not sure. 4/5Potato Skin: This was by far the best dish we had for the late afternoon. Artistically developed with a burst of flavor and multiple textures. It was medium-sized potato cups that contained assorted vegetables topped with melted cheese. \u00a0Globs of sour cream and guacamole were made available for dipping. \u00a0Mouth-watering experience! 5/5Fish Tacos: This was highly recommended by the same waitress for Matt. \u00a0When it came out the texture, without lemon, was dry. \u00a0The flavor was masked by the dryness as well. \u00a0The fish absorbed all saliva from my mouth and left it dry. \u00a0However, after applying drops of lemon, it made it taste like heaven. \u00a0What a magical difference! \u00a04/5Taco Salad: \u00a0Everything was great until I hit the bottom of the dish. \u00a0The refried beans were disgusting, burnt. \u00a0I couldn't handle it. \u00a0It is amazing that one wrong thing can abruptly ruin an entire dish! \u00a0Like the WHOLE thing. \u00a0It left burnt taste residue throughout my entire pallet of my tongue. \u00a0I had to wash it down with more Margarita. \u00a0Is there negative stars on here? 1/5Drinks: A whole pitcher of Margarita for me, and none for you! \u00a0Although the price was steep, as I saw it, we got it for free. \u00a0YES! \u00a0Omg. \u00a0Heaven in a glass is awesome. \u00a0I think I was inappropriate (but when am I not), as I licked the rim of the glass \"sexually\" in front of Matt. \u00a0He looked at me and said, \"Damn boy! \u00a0Jesus, calm down!\" \u00a0I wanted solace! \u00a0Do not judge me, old man!

The chips were really hard, almost too stale and the salsa was definitely from a can. I ordered the chicken taco salad (not too bad, but how can you screw up a taco salad) and my boyfriend ordered the three enchilada special (one cheese, one beef, one chicken). The enchiladas weren't too bad, but I've had better. I read about the margaritas online and how they were delicious, but honestly the only part that made them delicious was the overdose of alcohol in them.

Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. 2 stars. They do give you a small basket of chips with salsa but the salsa tasted spoiled so we just ate the chips. If you want another basket you have to pay for it so eat the one you got slowly. As many yelpers mentioned, they do charge for any extras like guacamole etc. So be aware.

All I tasted was cheese and mush. My date ordered beef enchiladas and he said it tasted as if it was previously frozen. He said it was bland and cold in the middle. We ended up pushing the food around on the plate & didn't finish it. There were only 3 tables when we got there on a Saturday night at 7pm, that should've been our first clue. No other customers came in while we were there. The highlight of my night: there were 4 military men in uniform sitting in the booth behind us. When they asked for the bill, the waitress told them it had been taken care of and pointed to an older couple's table. The older man came over to their table and thanked them for their service and told them it was his pleasure. My date and I both clapped, cheesy I know but, I was so touched by this man's kind gesture. Ok, sorry I got side-tracked.

She checked in on us and made small talk with my toddler son each time she came to the table.Here's where I was really impressed: after refilling our drinks, she noticed that my son's sippy cup was empty, and offered to wash it out and refill it with milk, as a courtesy. How's that one? 2 years and many family restaurants patronized as parents, and that's a first! Additionally, because we were dining with my parents who joined us later, she asked if we needed our tab split. Who does that?

Great atmosphere!Ok, so we came in fairly late on a friday night. \u00a0I work in the food and bev. industry and I know that is a bad thing to do. \u00a0However, I like to try new places with my special girl, we had this place in mind, I got off late, but we went for it. \u00a0We were very pleased to be greeted at the door and sat at a huge booth by a very freindly hostess. \u00a0She offered the signature margarita, told us how much she loved it, pointed out a few menu items and left us to ponder.The decor was anything you would see in Cabo or San Felipe, typical mexican busy dining atmosphere. \u00a0Because we arrived so late, the dining room was fairly empty, but the bar was seemingly the place to be. \u00a0Lots of guests having fun. \u00a0If we weren't here for a date night, we would have joined the crowd at the bar.The waitress (sorry I forget her name, Tracy?) greeted us with chips and salsa and pointed out her favorites on the menu. \u00a0I am not a huge salsa fan (my better half is) but I was eating it up. \u00a0Great tomato and cilantro mix with a little spice. \u00a0Chips seemed homemade, thick and airy.Margaritas came quick, I had the signature scratch, she had the pomegranate...both were very delicious.We started with sharing the meatball soup. \u00a0Holy moly...it was very tasty with large meatballs and a great broth.We ordered the Snow crab enchilada for her and the chicken enchilada for me. \u00a0Being somewhat of a foodie, my first test is the plate check. \u00a0I always touch the plate first to see if it is hot and will sustain the meal. \u00a0I guess I didn't need to as the waitress firmly stressed that the plates were very hot, and she was not joking. \u00a0The plates were searingly hot, and I expressed to my better half that this is a great sign to a great meal.Not sure how Jose's stays in business, her Crab enchilada was over stuffed with so much crab she could not believe. \u00a0She thought she won the lottery. \u00a0The flavor was well balanced with the beans and rice, and so much crab! \u00a0She is a crab fiend, and I think Jose took her down...she could not handle and we had to take some home (she enjoyed it twice!)Chicken enchiladas were very flavorful with lots of chicken and a great mix with all of the other flavors.We didn't think we had it in us, but we took a shot at the dessert menu. \u00a0We asked the waitress if we were keeping her, but she pointed at the bar and stated she will be there for a while. \u00a0We never felt rushed or hurried like she needed to leave. \u00a0We tried the flan and it was very tasty. \u00a0We thought we might take a few bites and take it home, but it was gone in a few minutes (tasted so good we were fighting for it). \u00a0It had a different texture and was thicker than what i am used to, seemed much more home made than what you get at other restaurants. \u00a0Perfect end to a great meal...get the flan!I would definately eat here again...the food and service were exceptional...the manager was very present in the dining room and touched our table quite a few times and thanked us as we left. \u00a0The bar seems like a happenning place and a great place to go for sports. \u00a0Next time I will probably bring some friends for some monday night football and margaritas.Only reason I gave it 4 stars is that we are not in mexico or southern cal...we are in Hawaii...but for being 3000 miles away....Jose's does mexican food well....", "Date": "2011-09-05", "Author_Location": "Waipahu, HI"}, {"Author": "Les Is More M.", "ReviewID": "lElwxhw-qTfx_7TVrm9GZA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this place is well known to have arguably the best mexican food in town... at least until MEXICO restaurant opened up in kalihi. \u00a0but either way, good quality and the margaritas here are hard to beat. \u00a0I had one of the best margarita pitchers ever here, and even tipped the waitress and bartender, challenging them to make a second as good as the first. \u00a0sure enough, awesome. \u00a0now they don't offer the li hing margarita like mexico restaurant does, but there's something to be said for the more traditional menu selection. \u00a0parking is plentiful, and service has always been satisfactory the many times I've been here. \u00a0will definitely be back. \u00a0I just wish there was a mariachi band playing, instead of the run-of-the-mill staff that may give you the \"I'm just working my way through college\" vibe. \u00a0still, I'd go back again and/or suggest others try it. \u00a0I think mexico has an edge over menu selection and quality, but as I mentioned before, jose's has a more traditional menu.", "Date": "2012-12-08", "Author_Location": "Honolulu, HI"}, {"Author": "L K.", "ReviewID": "LgssnN6crQd86D6h0kzRng", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My family & I took our Dad/Papa to dinner at Jose's for his 78th birthday & service was the worst I have ever experienced anywhere. It took a long time for someone to take a drink order & forever for us to receive our drinks. And the drink order to was wrong which I had to wait again. The server asked if we wanted chips & the chips came but without salsa & it is normally served with salsa. So, we asked for salsa & the server said, \" oh yes it's in the back.\" Then, we never got it at all. My son ordered an appetizer & when another person delivered it she asked if we wanted plates & we responded yes & never got that until we waited so long that I had to get up & ask someone else for plates. We then ordered our food & waited, waited, waited, & waited with no explanation as to why our food was taking so long. We even ordered more drinks while waiting for food & we waited & waited for our drinks. Our food finally came 45 minutes later & when we started to eat, the server then told us that the kitchen was backed up. Okay, most times they would let us know the status of our food while the delay is happening ....NOT after the fact. Anyway, the restaurant was slow & we would have been fine if we didn't have to wait for our drinks & if the server gave us the status of our food. Just a reminder, we had a 78 year old & a 3 year old that needed to eat. Well, that's not the worst, the server dropped the check & within a minute was back to collect payment & that was the first time the whole night she had moved so quickly & attentively to our table. After looking over the bill an 18% gratuity was added & we did not believe she deserved the tips. My daughter asked to see the manager & told her about the service or should I say the lack of service we received & that the gratuity was not earned & we was not willing to pay that & maybe we would be willing to pay 15%. (Which my daughter should never had said.)Anyway, they took the 18% off & added 15% instead & we still did not agree with that. \u00a0It should have been left blank & up to our discretion. We did pay the bill but not without the server giving us her insincere apologies & her bad attitude. My daughter explained to her in a nice way that we would have been okay if she told us what was going on & being attentive instead of waiting to after the fact. The special occasion did not end up very special & the server deserved less than 10%. And my review is not to be demeaning but it is the fact & I have been to Jose's before & service was okay but this time it was terrible.
