Guajillada. \u00a0It's nothing fancy, basically a quesadilla but using pita bread instead of a tortilla and steak with actual flavor instead of bland beef fajitas. \u00a0Simple but oh-so addictive. \u00a0I'd recommend one (or two) to soak up all that booze.Only negative about Guajillo's is the ceviche. \u00a0I've tried the fish and shrimp ceviche, shrimp cocktail and the campechano. \u00a0While all came with a healthy serving, they tasted kinda store-bought for the most part. \u00a0The serrano in the campechano was the only saving grace so if you have a craving, it's the best option.", "Date": "2014-07-11", "Author_Location": "San Antonio, TX"}, {"Author": "Sheri C.", "ReviewID": "2a3j3VKT4Cb2EKRnzPuaqA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Authentic Mexican tacos and soups.

They recently also opened Speisen, which is European cuisine but heavily Austrian influenced for their mother/her heritage. Cool! Anyway, Guajillo's is not Tex Mex...it's more like what I found on the street corners in Mexico, authentic. Being from San Antonio, I'm obviously partial to Tex Mex....it's my comfort food. But I like good food in general & Guajillo's is pretty good...We went for 2nd lunch (Luly & Pete...y'all crazy!) so my appetite wasn't up to snuff, I admit. The salsa is superb: pica, smoky yet kinda vinegary, complex. The chips aren't bad, but they're not good. We ordered an agua fresca...it's not homemade but from concentrate. It really had no flavor whatsoever but a fake sweet. It was sent back in exchange for another beverage. To eat, we ordered tacos de alambre, frijoladas (think I messed this up), and cochinita pibil. The tacos de alambre were good: small pieces of pork with bacon (sold!) & chargrilled peppers atop corn tortillas. It is crucial that you squeeze lime juice & put fresh cilantro & onion on top! The cochinita pibil was just ok....salty, not much flavor, kind of dry. I think it needed time to sit in the pot & the flavors shake up cause when I ate it the following day, it was much tastier! The pickled red onions that come with it are a must! I also generously topped it with fresh cilantro & onions. The beans are good. The rice is terrible: overly salty, not much flavor, mushy. The frijoladas were my favorite! If you don't like beans or refried beans, you're out of luck on this dish. It's a giant plate of refried beans atop a thick masa tortilla then topped with raw chopped onions & a dollop of sour cream. My first few bites were curious/unsure, but then I really started getting into it. Service was attentive & nice. The crowd was filling in when we left about 1pm. Most everything was good, not great.

You can't advertise that you are the \"shortcut to Mexico\" and serve chips straight from the bag plus they were on the stale side (minus 1 star for that). Come on fry some \u00a0real corn tortillas up for totopos- like the real ones.Anyway on to the food, the salsa that is served with the chips was pretty good. It had some heat but not overwhelming for the typical San Antonio palate. We started with the shrimp cocktail- \u00a0not my favorite. The shrimp were a little fishy & the sauce lacked some flavor- it needed some more lime juice, a little more \"something\". I wouldn't recommend. I had the tacos de bistek. These were really, really good. They had that flavor that is so hard to find & remind you of street tacos in Mexico. They are served with chopped onion & cilantro. The onion should be finely diced so that you don't have these large pieces in your tiny taco but I think I may be a little picky about stuff like that. The plate has six little bitty corn tortillas covered in the tasty \u00a0bistek (chopped steak of some sort). They should be served with some lime wedges but luckily they served some with the chips. They don't serve enchiladas but I had seen enmoladas on their menu on the web. When we got there I didn't see these on their current menu so when I asked they obliged (the waiter said they don't offer them only if customers request). So when these came I was pleasantly suprised- I felt like my grandma (rest her soul) was whipping these out in the kitchen. You see when I grew up, these were the only \"enchiladas\" we knew of (besides the \"delightful\" school cafeteria ones) there were no green ones or any other kind- just mole- but enough of my childhood. \u00a0Its really hard to find a place that makes enchiladas with mole sauce & then use queso fresco with diced onion- oh me! Oh MY! This is definitely the place.Okay selection of Mexican beer & they frozen margarita (1/2 lime/ 1/2 mango) was very good- even though the waiter thought I was nuts.

I'm not sure about the whole \"shortcut to Mexico\" tagline. But hey, kudos to whoever can be transported to Aztec land simply by eating decent tacos. Guajillos has nailed their salsa. It is superior to any other salsa I've tried in San Antonio. In fact, it is superior to the one I make.

The restaurant, owned and operated by the Father and Uncle of a close friend of mine provided me with a job to do during lunch as a high school senior. I actually ended up meeting my wife at this restaurant and loved everything about it. Fast forward a little more than a decade and Taco Inn has closed in order to open Guajillos. Guajillos is by all accounts everything that made Taco Inn a great place, but with so much more to offer. The same family owns and operates Guajillos so I have the familiarity and comfort of feeling like I'm back at Taco Inn. The food is excellent and always has been. I've eaten almost everything on the menu and every once in awhile my close friend who manages the place offers me up something special that is not on the menu. Everytime I've been blown away by the speed of which the food arrives and more importantly, the flavor that it brings with it. Having a wife from south-central Mexico its hard to find authentic Mexcan cuisine in this town. Its funny because you would think it wouldnt be that hard considering the large population of Mexican restaurants. The only problem is that 99% of them are Tex-Mex...a bad combination of hard taco shells and made up dishes that do not even exist in Mexico. Guajillos provides the a meal experience that is so authentic that its hard to remember that we are sitting on 410 and Blanco and not in a taco shop in Mexico City.

I had dinner here last night and enjoyed everything about this place. The food is great, service was wonderful and accomodating, and the prices are a bargain. This is more what is known as \"Mexico City style\" Mexican food, meaning these are dishes that you are more likely to be served south of the border rather than at your standard TexMex places. So if you are looking for cheese enchiladas covered in chile con carne you won't find that here; however, what you will find are faithful renditions of time-honored dishes in all of Mexican gastronomy. My little boy and I arrived and were able to seat ourselves, which as I found out later was fortuitous. We were immediately greeted with chipsand a very delicious salsa that delivered a nice kick. I ordered the cochinita pebil,which is one of my very favorite Mexican dishes. it came with of course the obligatory rice and beans and a relish of spicy picked red onions,and let me tell you,spicy was the operative word. Their pebil was perfectly cooked, and well speasoned. It had it's own bit of heat too,but with the onions it builds on that heat. Though they didn't have akids menu they \u00a0were more than happy to fashion him a quesadilla with shredded chicken. They really loaded the chicken on there too. He loved it and so devoured it. We split a piece of tres leches cake for dessert and that was good. we got a bowl of fideo for Momma who was at home under the weather, and she told me it was wonderful. In all our bill after tax and before tip came to just over 20 bucks. What a great value! I'll definitely go back, there's so much more on their menu that I want to try. I am glad that they have my favorite dish there though. It's always good to have a usual.

I've sampled most of the tacos, apps, and soups, but still have yet to get over to the specialties side of the menu, although it looks delicious. I just can't seem to tear myself away from the tacos alambre. Today's visit featured the delicious and simple fideo and aforementioned tacos alambre obsession. It returned me to life after a crappy morning.A couple of warnings for the faint-hearted: the tortilla soup is not the usual stuff your abuela made or that you can get at Taco Cabana or Chilis. It's dark, it's spicy, it's flavorful, but it will definitely be a surprise if you're expecting the lighter version. Also, as some reviewers have pointed out, and something that also remains a mystery to me, despite the authenticity of the food and overall great flavors, the rice is so terrible. Like utterly bland and dull and unexciting terrible. I'm sure it starts off with the greatest of intentions, and I'm aware that even simple dishes like rice have their own territorial or familial recipes and variations, but at the same time, could ya get a little more flavor there? Maybe a bit of garlic and more chicken stock? It really is a generic Mexican Tio Ben's rice there and it leaves me dumbfounded every time. I expected that in New England, but not in Texas.One last gripe: the parking. I don't think it's been covered, but the parking situation can be a little weird. The parking lot itself is too small for the restaurant, so if it's a peak time, you're going to be navigating driveways and sharp turns behind the restaurant. There are signs warning everyone about NOT using the overfill parking, and although we've yet to be towed for using the closer lot on the side, I'm still about erring on the side of caution at times. So be prepared for a hike in the back parking lot if it's lunch or dinner rush.Next time I go back I swear I'm ordering a specialty dish.

I didn't want to be bothered with flagging down my waiter again, so I just ate cold food. Dessert was rice pudding, which was okay, but nothing to write home about. Better than Kozy Shack cups from the store, but not by too much. Margarita was drinkable, but not something that I'd order again for flavor or buzz-catching purposes.

It was dry and had burn marks on it, which led me to think it may have been reheated. The salsa on the chicken was okay and didn't have any \"heat\" factor, even though menu describes sauce as having serrano peppers.Plate includes rice and beans. The rice was disappointing, as it was too light and not much flavor. The refried beans were just fine, as they were fresh and had good flavor. The corn tortillas were not good, as they tasted like bulk pkg style. My friend \u00a0who is never critical of anything or anyone, briefly opined that the bistec tacos were not good, so I can't elaborate on her opinion without any further detail. As we exited the restaurant, my friend told me that she noticed a sign stating that they use \"healthy\" style cooking and ingredients. Maybe that explains the shortcomings I observed.

We were looking for something easy, quick, delicious, and inexpensive. Not an easy task. Then Janie remembered Guajillos and their inexpensive taco plates. We immediately turned the car around and headed in their direction. Upon arrival we were immediately seated and promptly tended to. Our waiter (I did not ever catch his name) was nice enough and very attentive to our needs. The place itself is nonassuming and very plainly decorated; however, they were not crying for business. I knew I would be in for a good meal. The chips and salsa, oh the chips and salsa. What a heavenly combination! Thick cut, freshly fried tortilla chips sprinkled with salt and lime. Smokey, delisciously spiced salsa.... oh, it was like walking on sunshine! I could have eaten a few dishes all by myself. In hindsight I wish that I had asked for some to go. I ordered the bistec tacos and Janie had the pork carnitas with cheese. When Janies arrived she was slightly disappointed that the cheese on the tacos was more of a runny sauce than shredded cheese, but they looked good none the less. The one thing I did find somewhat strange though was that the meat was cooked separately from the onion and cilantro. Instead, the condiments are served on the side. For this reason I felt that the meat was a little undereseasoned. The plate consisted of six corn tortillas and a heaping pile of thinly cut beef. The beef was also slightly dry/chewy which I chalked up to the lacking of prep time with the veg. With the addition of all the acoutrmonts (to include the heavenly salsa), they made for some extraordinary bites :) Janie's pork carnitas were scrumptious but I made her scrape off the cheese sauce. By the time I tasted one the cheese had developed an odd, congealed texture which did not look particularly appetizing. The meat was very flavorful as hers had been cooked along with onion and peppers. \u00a0I also ordered a side of refried beans. They were a little salty, and heavier than I'm normally accustomed to; I ate them all none the less. For under $10 this was truly a fantastic meal...

Aside from the tortillas, a great place, it will definitely get more of my money.", "Date": "2010-09-28", "Author_Location": "San Antonio, TX"}, {"Author": "Don V.", "ReviewID": "Z-qRmrZ1kKilKDcwLeY0mA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was impressed I usually don't like authentic Mexican but this wasn't bad.
