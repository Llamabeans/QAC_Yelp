He never stops bothering me about it so the first time we went, we spent $60 and lasted about an hour on games. Definitely not worth it. So we decided to come on Wednesday which is half price games and still paid the $57. Much better deal! Because 2 hours of gaming for the both of us is fun, and the perfect amount of time! The issue why I docked some stars is because about 5 games (we were positive we won) wouldn't spit out tickets. I didn't want to call someone every single time so I just dealt with it while feeling a little bit annoyed. So fun date night regardless! I opted for sweet tomatoes right next to Dave and busters as I didn't want bar food today and something with a little more nutritional value.", "Date": "2014-06-05", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "Mary G.", "ReviewID": "ddrz6rhZ6CeaydfrZqsa6g", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This place is kinda falling apart but I gave it 2 stars because the inside is kinda pretty.I especially like the glass mosaic thing they have inside the restaurant.

The vibe later in the evening is just completely different and the fact that the place is not state-of-the-art and only 1/3 the size of Boomers doesn't matter when you've had a drink or two (which you can't do at Boomers)- I have to agree with Brittany- that you just can't give this place more stars because the restrooms are seriously atrocious. I really had high hopes that D&B would realize that they were disgusting, and that while they renovated the front of the place, that they would also do something about the bathrooms. \u00a0However, they did not. \u00a0If you are not having a restroom emergency- DO NOT use the bathroom-", "Date": "2014-05-05", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "Samantha D.", "ReviewID": "yNtcAM8t3xA67sILK54lJw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We came here for my birthday since we have always liked Dave and Busters and have a lot of fun at them!

So we had to buy another card so we could play all the games together. The place itself wasn't the cleanest and looked run down. The bartender wasn't friendly or seemed to care if we wanted drinks. We would have had a lot more to drink if we would of got some service. Best part is that we won a TON of tickets! Within 5 mins of being there I won 500 tickets and my husband won 1000 tickets not long after me! Don't get me wrong we still had a blast but we wouldn't go back or recommend this location.

I went there yesterday night for my birthday. Easy parking. The place was packed!! As we entered we were charged $5.00 per adult which was something i was not aware of but it was ok. The view took my breath away. We decided to eat at the restaurant because we were starving and it looked beautiful. The entrance of the restaurant was a little confusing.We actually had to chase the hostess down \u00a0because we went through the back way instead of the entrance even though we walked by numerous servers they didnt bother to ask if we needed help. After we were able to find the hostess,We immediately got a table. It took about 5 minutes for a waiter to come and she was friendly but seemed uninterested. She looked like she was there to just serve you and thats it. Our food took about 10 minutes to come and everything looked great but we didnt have any silverware or napkins at our table so we had to wait 10 more minutes for the waiter to come back. I ordered the nachos and my husband the ribs with chicken wings. Honestly we ate half of it because we were really hungry but everything tasted like crap and the chicken wings were cold. The nachos tasted like pure prapika and taco mix powder. The ribs tasted old and stale. For the amount of money Dave & Busters make they should seriously consider changing the food and waiters should be more cautious to their guests. Other than that, the games, the atmosphere and the drinks at the bar are amazing. They have really really stepped up their game since a couple of years back. They have all the games you can think of from modern to arcade!! It was awesome! We ended up with 3,233 tickets got our prizes and left at 1:30 am. One issue we had was that there were some games that wouldt give you ticketsm we had to chase some of the guys that work there to help us with the tickets which was a little annoying. I had a great night but my stomach was not happy. The next day i spend the whole day on the toilet. Defenetly suggest skipping the restaurant if your coming here. There are various restaurants around that will give you wayyyy better quality food and doesnt force you to pay 18% of gratuity.

It's not good, but it's not terrible. It's food. I had ribs and my husband had cajun shrimp pasta, and they were both fine. There's definitely something for everyone on the extensive menu. The server was great! We also filled out surveys about the meal to get some free games.The game section is amazing -- it's clean and organized, not like some seedy arcades I've seen in malls before. It doesn't feel weird at all to be an adult playing games in there. There are tons of couples and groups going around, plus other people playing with their kids.There is a lot of variety, including the more traditional games like skeeball all the way to more modern games like Fruit Ninja!Overall, we had a great night and really enjoyed ourselves.

My girlfriend wanted to go bowling, but after that plan fell through I suggested Dave and Buster's.What's better than cocktails and video games? Nothing.We had the time of our lives.

Not only is it 3D, but your seat vibrates and some other cool stuff that actually makes you believe you are being attacked. 2. Don't miss the air hockey for four. Yes, four of you get the play each other at once. Just thought I'd throw that in there since I love air hockey and literally kick everyone's butt in it. My husband laughs at how competitive I am at that game! Haha.3. Do not go there at 10pm unless you want to wait forever for your drinks and food. The service was not that great. We had to order our drinks from the bar. 4. If you like margaritas this is the place! They are either made delish or horrible and they are definitely delicious here!5. If you order the calamari, expect about six pieces. It's good, but small. It comes with fried onions but that's pretty much all you get. They should call it the onion appetizer instead.6.

The descriptions sound great. But in reality, the food isn't so good. In fact, after many chances, I don't think I will be eating there ever again.

I end up having to go to the bar to get my refill. *The billiards area is nice, clean and there are usually plenty of waiters to refill your drinks. But one specific visit ruined the billiard area forever. Our waitress insisted on collecting a Credit Card to keep the tab open. She said that wasn't D&B policy, it was hers. Hmmm...ok. We told her that we were all separate, but she replied that she only needed one card. She took the Birthday Boy's Credit Card. When others in our party would try to pay for their drinks, she replied \"Birthday Boy is paying.\" Which he clearly wasn't. He ended up with a $300 bill that she refused to split up. Nice. * The game area is fine. It's great for adults and families. And, they have dining in the game area if you want to play while you eat. All in all, the place isn't THAT bad.

I felt like I was on another planet for 4 hours. \u00a0I could write a mini novella on this place but I'm going to keep it the highlights:The Good:*Food was good & was typical bar food.*Crowd was AMAZING for people watching. Families, first dates, high schoolers, slutty high schoolers, pregnant teenagers, etc. I love watching a hot mess and D&B more than exceeded my expectations.*Arcade games were fun if that's your thing. It's not mine but other people seemed to really enjoy themselves.The Bad:*16% gratuity on everything (food, drinks from the inside bar, drinks from the arcade bar, etc.) *The arcade area smells like mildew. 100% agree with other yelpers. *Our waitress was nice but definitely doing the bare minimum. We had to flag down multiple people after our food arrived for simple stuff that could have been avoid like having silverware, condiments, soft tacos for fajitas, etc.. The Undecided:*They don't take reservations. We waited an hour and \u00a01/2 for a party of 20 and we seated at 2 separate tables within eyesight of each other.*There was an 18% gratuity for parties of 8 or more. They didn't charge it to our party but I'm not sure why.Overall, I'm torn between what to give this place. A part of me thinks \"This place isn't bad if you know what you're getting into! 3 Stars!\" But, then I think about the forced gratuity, and it just knocks it down to a 1 star. I get having automatic gratuity on large parties but for every item from any size table? It's just like a giant sign from management \"We think you're a cheap jerk! Now give us your money and we hope you accidentally leave another tip!\" Gross.Splitting the difference and going with 2.", "Date": "2012-04-22", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "Nicholas M.", "ReviewID": "hOJBcJO4rALhWrKLLODPXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't been here in years. \u00a0But they have completely cleaned up the place and the food, \u00a0and service was great. \u00a0I will definitely be coming back more often.", "Date": "2013-12-13", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "Shaun M.", "ReviewID": "3_Qyo_T_UUmb-1DLmnAj6g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, I've been to D&B across the USA, and have never experienced the awesome service that I got here.

There are several dinning areas and bars which you can eat and play or dine separately. I normally at a table in the bar area after playing a few games.

I have heard their games are fun, but we went for a quick drink. We sat ourselves down at the bar, and waited about 10 minutes till our server showed up. She was friendly, but not an attentive server. My Husband ordered a Lynchburg Lemonade which came out PINK (normally yellow) and very weak. Also, the cup was filled with 80% ice, and 20% drink. Gone in 2 gulps. When she brought it, she called my Husband \"Sweets\" (what's up with that?) I ordered a Mudslide, which was completely weak and tasteless. The ice cream was so watered down, it wasn't creamy anymore, and they put just 1 squirt of chocolate.The drink was white instead of the normal brown color. Our friend had a decent piece of cake. The bill ordeal took about 20 minutes, as our server disappeared. Then once we gave her the card, it took another 10 minutes. Service=stinks. Drinks=stink.

We had been years ago to play pucks but we havent been in years. We purchased a $10 card for 60 Minutes of games for each kid. They had a wonderful time and loved it. It didnt include the ticket games but it really was perfect for an hour of fun! We sat at the bar and had a couple drafts. They have large drafts. We also purchased the Nachos. Those had been amazing. Very very good! They came out in about 4 minutes. We had a minor issue while we had been there and the manager came over and took care of us. We received very good customer service. I felt like they really wanted to do right by the customer. The bar staff was very friendly. The rest of the staff had just been doing their jobs and really not making an effort to be helpful. I guess if you go before 7pm and get that $10 card, it is a great deal.
