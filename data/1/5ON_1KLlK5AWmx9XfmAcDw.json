My husband and I go at least once or twice per month! Known for their delicious seafood dishes, they have so much to choose from on the menu... There's something for everyone.I generally order the pollo a la parilla and it's simply divine. The chicken is always grilled to perfection, the caesar salad is my favorite in town (it includes hearts of palm!!) and it's served with tasty rice and beans. It's a great portion, especially if you're really hungry!No Mexican dinner is complete without margaritas!! And honestly, you really can't go wrong with your drink order. They make delicious cocktails, have a nice wine list and beer selection too. My husband always gets a giant beer in a frosty glass!The prices may surprise you but it's money well spent. The service, food and atmosphere are 100% worth it.

Unfortunately they do not have a brunch menu online, so I can't tell you what I had, but the server did tell me it was basically a deconstructed Mexican version of a McMuffin (since it was a english muffin, mayonaise, egg, and ham). It also came with hashbrowns and beans. I came with a friend that everyone knew so I felt at home and comfortable immediately. We ordered coffee and breakfast. We did not get any chips (I guess since it was brunch). Our meals came quick enough, however mine was kind of cold. The sandwich was good, but the hasbrowns were mediocre (nothing compares to Waffle House hashbrowns) and the beans were cold. We ended up ordering a Chispa each (margarita made with lime juice, triple sec and tequila) which was the best thing about this place. That is how I have always made my margaritas, so it was great to have one like that at a restaurant with brunch. They are very strong, so make sure to eat your entire (cold) breakfast or you may be stumbling a little. Our waiter was very nice and talkative and asked us if we knew where the world most expensive coffee came from. We were stumped. He said in South America an animal eats the beans, defecates them, they are dried then roasted, so essentially there are feces in it. I didn't know what to say. It may just be me, but I personally don't like talking abut feces over brunch. So if you go to this restaurant and your server asks you about the worlds most expensive coffee, stop him there! (Though after a few Chispas you may find it hilarious).", "Date": "2014-07-22", "Author_Location": "Dallas, TX"}, {"Author": "Luis E.", "ReviewID": "2EVT-fiSE3WgFYatRRmoYg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Time: Saturday AfternoonLocation: Alamo HeightsPrice: 13.95 + the cost of drinkFood: Chile RellenoPoblano pepper filled with ground Beef or Mozzarellacheese topped with Ranchera sauce.

Or the price tag, for that matter. ($50+ for two) What an unfortunate discovery. Driving in, you cannot help but notice the beautiful scenery surrounding this hidden spot. I wish it had not been raining so we could've been seated on the gorgeous patio. Inside was another story; loud and hectic! Being PACKED, I was immediately excited for the adventure laying ahead for my taste buds and stomach! We were seated quickly, promptly asked for out drink order, but slowly brought salsa and our drinks. The margarita tasted bitter and my daiquiri watery. The salsa was abysmal. Eugene L. had me anxious for the three salsas- we were only served one. Boo! The ranchera salsa was not bad, it just had NO kick whatsoever. The tacos al pastor were SALTY!!! Sodium overload!!! My dining companion had the tacos nortenos and they were just alright. The rice was stale and beans were blah. FABULOUS queso flameado, however, kudos! This bumped Soluna up to three stars.

Seriously, I had one and a beer and a nap was necessary afterwards. Definitely sets the tone and gets the laughs going!Service was good, I thought...but, I'm pretty low maintenance and we were released early from work so we planned on having a \"European lunch\" (2+ hours, multiple courses). Our server's name was Jesus...he was fun times....we kept telling him \"Happy Birthday\" since Christmas was the previous day and he just cracked up so he had a sense of humor, which is always appreciated by this crowd. To start, the chips & roasted salsa are yums...we took it a step further and ordered the guacamole. It was simple, creamy, and unsalty and rimmed with fresh pico de gallo. You must combat the chispas with food asap, y'all. Take my word for it. For lunch, I ordered the enchiladas del mar. Delicious! Echis stuffed with crab, shrimp, and fish with a delightful tangy cream sauce on top. It comes with white rice and fried plantains (snooooze), but I nixed that and asked for Mexican rice and refried beans. The shrimp tacos were amazing: fresh shrimp with a crunchy slaw and a nice toasted corn tort with lots of white cheese. The borracho beans were very tasty, too. I also had a bite of the cheese enchis, which were pretty dang good. In our drunken state, we also ordered the rajas con queso quesadillas, but they were packed up to go so I didn't get a bite of 'em, but, how can you go wrong with grilled rajas right?! I'd definitely recommend ordering something seafood-y at Soluna...it tastes fresh, not frozen, and they know how to do it up right. Top it all off (and combat afternoon hangover) with a double espresso...the BEST I've had since moving back from Europe.

I used to LOVE their chicken caesar salads with chips and salsa, but this last visit has made me rethink that feeling. Their food (salads, anyway) is very inconsistent and doesn't always have the same ingredients or portions as the last time it was ordered. This most recent time I did manage to get artichoke hearts and hearts of palm in my salad. Sadly, both the artichoke hearts and hearts of palm were no longer good or \"fresh\" tasting (I am aware that they are canned). The chips that they served were also funny tasting as though they were cooked in old oil. The salsa, as usual, was out-of-this-world-delicious but just could not make up for the chips and salad toppings. Like I said, I'm going to take another break and see if they've worked out the kinks the next time I visit.

If you've read even 1% of my previous reviews, then you know I'm a sucker for an outdoor oasis. They've got that and more. While not my first choice for straight up Tex-Mex, I like that you can indulge here or stay a bit on the healthy side. The ensalada mar y sol is one of my favorite healthy choices - a generous bed of greens topped with perfectly grilled shrimp and fresh lump crab meat. Those shrimp are fat, juicy, and not overly seasoned. The creamy white balsamic dressing that comes with it is a wonderful citrusy complement. I've gotten pretty tipsy off of the stronger than usual margs here. I wish their guacamole was chunkier and better seasoned, although it is still very fresh. As others have mentioned, service is never spectacular.

Yes, the patio is nice, but as far as food and drinks go I am definitely not a fan. I ordered the mango margarita because the waitress said that they are good. It was awful. I couldn't take more than a sip or two and then had it taken away because it tasted like Tang mixed in with a gross premade margarita mix. My enchiladas were so so but finding chicken bones in one of them all but killed my appetite. The wait staff and hostess were not stellar (as has been mentioned time and time again in their reviews). Overall I will stick with either Paloma Blanca or Picante Grill..unless I'm feeling ballsy and want to try their paella that Juliana P. raves about.
