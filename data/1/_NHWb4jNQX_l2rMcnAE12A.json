Well, if they offered some cash incentive. LOLI was promptly greeted by wait staff when i walked up outside. And since the weather was awesome we sat outside. I ordered the 1/2 sandwich, soup, and salad. I absolutely love their baby spinach salad, the nuts, fruit and dressing blend very well together. Then the lobster bisque. I have to say I was expecting a little bit more with this. The soup was smooth, but I was hoping for much more lobster in the soup. And I did a BLT for the sandwich not much more excitement there. In the past I have had the grilled portabella sandwich. This sandwich is all you can hope for and MUCH more. The basil pesto is delicious and mouthwatering. Now I was told the pastry chef here was awesome so I tried a the carmel bread pudding. Talk about AWESOME SAUCE! \u00a0I thought I had died and gone to heaven. The carmel was warm and smooth, there was a nice touch of cinnamon and layered perfectly. Hands down this is one of the best bread puddings I have ever had. I can not wait to go back.

The grand mimosa was so-so and way overpriced for the small glass. -go with the Maryland Benedict (crab cakes and eggs Benedict). Thanks to the other yelpers who suggested it. -salmon scramble was good-service was very slow and pretty much non existent for most of our visit. We were expecting this based on previous reviews so no surprise thereIn summary, I'm glad we tried this place for brunch. We stuck with yelpers suggestions so we weren't disappointed with the food.

I honestly can't tell you how many time I've been to Wildflower as this is easily my favorite establishment in St. Louis. I've only been here once for brunch; (and while I have eaten many quesadillas during the late hours) I advise this review accounts for mostly the social drinking aspect. I've gotten to know a few bartenders here but Sam comes across as one of the most friendly I've met. Equally as important, he is exceptional at his trade and I have yet to hand an empty glass to Sam and ask for his latest creation and not get an exceptional concoction. I won't soon forget that fat Will is the best bar back I've ever encountered and his drinks are excellent as well.

We were short on time and decided that because it was fairly nice we could, but we were a tad chilly during brunch and it probably wouldn't have been our preference to do so. \u00a0We had one server for awhile but she just kind of stopped coming back. \u00a0Someone else eventually came over and asked if she could help us. \u00a0The place seemed really disorganized. \u00a0 Our drinks took a VERY long time to be made, and service was exceptionally slow. \u00a0The place wasn't even that busy, which was part of why I was surprised that we were asked to sit outside. \u00a0The strawberry mojito was horrible. My boyfriend has never sent a drink back but this was undrinkable. It tasted like dirty water, as if the basil hadn't been cleaned. \u00a0Also the mint/basil wasn't muddled, just big hunks of leaves floating in the drink with some non ripe strawberries chopped up in there. \u00a0He ordered a regular mojito in its place but that just tasted like fizzy lime water. \u00a0Couldn't taste any alcohol and again, the mint was dirty and not muddled. \u00a0 \u00a0Of the 4 entrees, the best was the crabcake benedict. The gravy covered benedict was also very good. The Wild Thing scramble was so bland I had to use some gravy from someone elses plate to make it enjoyable. \u00a0The pancakes with apples and walnuts were fine, but could have easily been made at home for a fraction of the price. \u00a0 I used to live in the central west end and have always heard great things about this place but it was the opposite for the four of us. \u00a0When you're only in town for so long you want each restaurant to be good since you have limited time and this was a total disappointment.", "Date": "2014-04-09", "Author_Location": "Philadelphia, PA"}, {"Author": "Doug B.", "ReviewID": "JAfhEqJyPPKmQpcAsBXHrg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wonderful Sunday brunch.

The focaccia bread served with olive oil and grated cheese is excellent as well.I came for with my husband this weekend for my birthday dinner and decided on the wild mushroom fettuccine. There were mushrooms in every single bite and the light sauce really allowed their mild flavor to come through. My husband went with his favorite, the ribs. It's a very large portion served with green beans and macaroni and cheese. He has ordered these many times in the past, and though the meat usually just falls right off the bone, they were a little tough this time around. Hopefully that won't be the case again next time though. I was able to choose a birthday dessert and went with the chocolate cake. Good choice! It was drizzled with chocolate sauce and coated in a rich chocolate icing. This is a perfect spot to enjoy a nice day on the patio or come for a romantic date night.

It was my first time there because it seems like Yelp reviews have mentioned that the wait/service isn't the greatest. But I was pleasantly surprised by our service--our waitress was attentive and they refilled our water often and were very accommodating.We were seated inside, and it seemed like the restaurant was a bit empty besides us and a few other tables. I ordered the Capelli Pescatore, angel hair pasta with pesto sauce, shrimp, scallops, and mussels and my husband ordered the Grass Fed Organic Hanger Steak. We munched on some delicious bread dipped in balsamic vinegar and olive oil as we waited for the food. I LOVED my husband's steak. WildFlower does steak wonderfully. It was tender, juicy, and super flavorful. I pretty much ate off of my poor husband's plate most of the night! My pasta was ok---the shrimp and mussels were delicious, but the scallops were mediocre. I love scallops when they're done perfectly and super tender, but the scallops in the pasta were a bit chewy and lacked flavor. The pesto sauce was good but not amazing/flavorful. The portions were big so we had a bit of leftovers.The best part of the meal, besides the hanger steak, was that they have a dessert tray that you can choose from!! Since it was my birthday that night, the waitress said I could choose one dessert for free. It was hard because there were several different cheesecakes, caramel bread pudding, a cream-filled pastry puff thingy, and more choices. I ended up choosing the strawberry cheesecake and it was phenomenal. I liked that I could taste the strawberry within the cheesecake itself, and it came with fresh strawberries too. I ate that cheesecake way too fast because it was so good. Next time I'm coming back for the truffle mac n cheese, which we we really wanted to order but restrained ourselves from doing so because we knew our entrees would be more than enough.

For a place like this, repeat patronage hinges upon the quality of the service. \u00a0This is why the management should be concerned about our recent experience. \u00a0The bartender's rudeness was so profound that it manages to cast a pall over all of the things that Wildflower does passably. \u00a0I honestly have reservations about giving Wildflower my business again.", "Date": "2013-05-20", "Author_Location": "Saint Louis, MO"}, {"Author": "Shreya N.", "ReviewID": "WRhrS1ipUp_HIJ-V-9e91g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only been here once for one of my close friend's birthday.

The reason why is that I've only been back twice, but both times were in huge catered groups. I haven't come back with only one or two dining companions, and that may make a difference.So both times I've been back, I've been upstairs in what they call \"The Loft\". The first was for a wedding reception last year, and honestly, I wouldn't have changed my rating at that time. It was super crowded during the mingling, the dinner, and the dancing afterwards, almost to the point of claustrophobia. I had the Cognac Chicken, which is still on the menu nowadays, and I really wasn't that impressed. Good serving size, but it was on the dry side. It was even worse because the bar was closed during dinner, and so all you had was either water or the rest of the drink that you had ordered before dinner (not sure if this is Wild Flower's policy or was decreed by bride and groom). Lesson learned? You cannot fit 100 people upstairs!Last month I went for a recruiting dinner. I was not looking forward to it, secondary to these past experiences, but the recruiter had been super sweet to me, and who knows who'll you meet while networking, right? I was pleasantly surprised. They had sort of a happy hour prior to dinner with an open bar and cheese, fruit, and crackers. Your usual stuff. It was very comfortable seating...there were about fifty seats available.

We were all really starved so fellow Yelper Mary Kate A. suggested we hit up Wildflower because they have some great lunch options.We didn't need to make a reservation which was awesome. We just walked on in! It took a little while for them to take our order but it gave us enough time to decide which we actually needed since I'd never been here for lunch before and I couldn't really make recommendations. I know I had to try the lobster bisque though!My mom ordered the goat cheese salad with salmon on top, my boyfriend got the club sandwich thing with fries, and my dad ordered the tomato bisque (bowl.) I had the mushroom ravioli and the lobster bisque. I tried a little of each dish except for my bf's sandwich so I can't comment on it. He said he really liked the fries even though they had some kind of herb seasoning on them and my mom agreed. His sandwich was \"okay.\"The lobster bisque was really light! I was so shocked! Usually lobster bisque is really heavy and leaves you feeling guilty the rest of the day but this stuff was nice and light and still flavorful. A+The mushroom fettuccine, on the other hand, wasn't as great. It actually was kind of bland and I had to keep forcing salt and pepper all over it because of that. I also had no clue it came with chicken. I didn't recall reading that on the menu. But it's not veg-friendly, if you're a vegetarian, but maybe they can make it veg if you ask. Not a problem for me. The chicken had an odd texture to it which resembled the mushrooms. Maybe that was intentional to make all of the textures blend together on the dish, but I'm not sure. It was only 3/5 stars in my book.My dad's soup was delicious too. Not creamy like I pictured when I heard the word \"bisque\" but rather nice and light. It tasted like they used fresh tomatoes just picked from a garden. Soooo good! I was worried when my dad said \"it tastes like pasta sauce\" but little did I know it would be awesome pasta sauce! He also had a beer.My mom's salad was also quite tasty. They went light on the dressing, thankfully, and the candied pecans were to die for. The goat cheese was nice and sharp too. The salmon was cooked a little too well done for my tastes but she seemed to enjoy it, so all was well.I would probably come back here for lunch because they're one of the few places that still serve between the hours of 2pm and 5pm which to me, is (was?!) a huge deal because I'd have classes all through out the \"normal\" lunch hour thus causing me to miss a lot of places open for lunch.

Food: 5 out of 50My friend & I went here for brunch this past weekend while strolling in the CWE. I had never been here before and was excited to try it out. That is where my excitement stopped. SAD. We ordered the Wild Thing Scramble, a side of fruit and a mojito to split. The mojito came out after the food, I think the bartender was still sleeping, and it tasted like 7up or Sprite. It only had 3 mint leaves in it and they were quite sad looking. Over all the drink was horrible. The Scramble was equally as bad. The scramble was under seasoned if seasoned at all and the brie was in one giant clump of terror in the center. The English muffin and potatoes were ok but not enough so to save the dish. The fresh fruit was just a bowl of fresh fruit. I'm glad I ordered something that could not get messed up. Over all a very SAD brunch. Service: 5 out of 25The service was slow and inattentive. I did not see my waiter often and when I did see him he seemed like he had too much going on to pay attention to my table. I believe he was the only one working the patio so it was not his fault. The manager should have recognized the issue and assigned some help. The only saving grace for the service was the fact that he took the mojito off of my bill without asking any questions.

My beautiful wife and wonderful mother in law decided to check this place out and I have to say, it was one of the best dinning experiences I have had this calendar year.First off, I love the look of this place. It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be but I like bar on one side and the restaurant on the other. And the outdoor area looks very lovely.Also the service here was on point. Considering it was a buffet style brunch, the servers and bus boys/girls were extremely helpful explaining the menu and our options.Now the best part of the experience for me was the food. This had to be one of the best meals I've had in a while. We had an option between an actually lunch food and breakfast food. I ended up stick with breakfast just because it was so good. French toast, breakfast potatoes, and the bacon was all cooked to perfection. They even had a crab with eggs item that I didn't eat (not a seafood fan) but looked good.After two helpings of breakfast, I had one of there coffee shooters. It was a coffee mousse that had just the right amount of coffee in it. Add a little chocolate syrup in there and you pretty much have a meal that put me over the top.The most important thing for this meal was the overall experience for my mother in law, who recently lost her mother within the past year. She thought it was perfect and couldn't have asked for anything else. I couldn't have agreed moreBased on the service I received and the quality of food, I give Wildflower a very high recommendation.

I searched for a restaurant near the Fox Theater in Saint Louis that had gluten-free options, as my wife must eat gluten-free. We found this restaurant in a Google proximity as the second highest rated restaurant offering gluten-free food. The menu had a wide variety, so we gave it a try. We're both glad we did, because it was a wonderful meal that we both enjoyed immensely. \u00a0Prior to our dinners being served, the staff brought out a small loaf of freshly baked, gluten-free bread. We've had many types of gluten-free bread, but this one left the rest in the dust. You could hardly tell at all that it was gluten-free. Usually, gluten-free bread is very grainy and dry and you can tell it doesn't have wheat, but it was definitely hard to tell that this was not a wheat-flour based bread.  \u00a0Prior to our arrival, my wife had chosen the pork tenderloin dinner from reading the online menu. We were disappointed to learn that it was recently removed from the menu, and had been replaced by a pork chop plate. She decided to stick with that instead and was not disappointed. It was served with fresh mashed potatoes and a side of asparagus. The bone-in pork chop was tender, cooked to perfection and quite large.  \u00a0 I decided on the salmon filet dinner.

Greeted us with his kind smiles and described the specials so well it made our mouths water. Even though we came in a BIG group, our food came out in perfect timing. We didn't wait long at all. Maybe it seemed that way because we were enjoying their delicious bottles of wine & drinks. The shrimp and grits were AMAZING!!! Great flavors and the shrimps were super juicy! I got the rib eye and it came perfectly cooked at medium rare and was perfectly seasoned. You know when a restaurant serves amazing food when you are sitting in a group of 20 and no one is talking because everyone is shoving food in their face. Everyone was also bragging about how good their dish was and shared bites with each other telling each other that they HAVE to try their dish. Every dish that I had tasted were phenomenal! Everyone's plate was taken away with nothing on them besides a lemon wedge or a bone. I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone.

The serving was small, even for lunch portions, (especially in relation to the price) and I know that it's not easy to cook thin noodles, but they were pretty mushy. Although tasty, it just wasn't up to St. Louis standards for Italian foods, plus the spinach and capers did an excellent job of hiding from my probing fork, when, for the money, they should have been out and about, mingling with the pasta. Unfortunately, the service was equally as shy, exhibiting a sluggish indifference. I was definitely disappointed as I recall enjoying this place several years ago.

Up next: the main course. I wasn't too hungry so I figured I would order a fresh salad - the Antipasto salad with mozarella cheese, tomatoes and olives (I think). The salad was enough to feed a small rabbit for $7 and some change. My bf was famished and ordered some sort of roasted chicken dish with mashed potatoes in a pastry. Keeping with the trend, this was not enough to even make a dent in his hunger for $17. The salad and the chicken were good, but not worth the money.
