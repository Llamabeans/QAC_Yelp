They always have fantastic seasonal specials with a constantly changing menu. I know whatever I order I will not be disappointed, and for that reason its a go to staple for me. I even find myself ordering things I normally don't like because I know its going to be good. The preparation of the food and presentation is always immaculate and the end result is \u00a0= DELICIOUS ! I literally have never ordered anything there that I did not like. \u00a0The duck is phenomenal! If you go you must order this. The owners are freaking awesome, very chill and down to earth and also very accommodating. The dining experience at Petite is reminiscent of Europe , where you never feel rushed. You are able to truly enjoy your food without feeling like you are being pushed out the door. This is \u00a0indeed a good thing because you HAVE to stay for dessert. The chef makes the best bread pudding you will ever taste in your entire life!

Bread.

This was very good the beans matched well and the flavorful sauce made this a wonderful appetizer. Then for the main we both ordered - Free Range Rack of Lamb, Eggplant, Roasted Peppers and Garlic. Wow the rack was cooked to perfection medium rare, so succulent that I was chewing the bone. Yummy!! I did have to ask for salt and pepper cause there are none on the tables. I felt awkward like someone would yell at me if I asked. But I did and the waitress was polite enough to grind some salt and white pepper all over this wonderful Rack of Lamb.For dessert I had the - Fallen Chocolate Souffle with Ice Cream.

That's why I chose it for a special occasion, my Valentine's gift to my boyfriend. We are on a budget, so it was a highly-anticipated night. I won't ever go back. Here's why: The owner/waitress called to confirm our reservation that day, I confirmed it. We drove around the area for 30 minutes looking for parking-- I am from Bay Ridge, I know parking isn't great, but since the Petit Oven is not usually open on Mondays but made an exception for Valentine's Day I thought maybe they'd have valet, and we left with enough time to park anyway. No matter, once we were ten minutes late I called the number that had called me to confirm the reservation just to let them know. I got no answer. Our reservation was at 8, we rolled in at 8:15. We were seated while a second waitress told the owner/waitress that we arrived. She came over at 8:17 (I had just checked my phone and noted the time) and said \"Hey guys, what time was your reservation?\" I told her 8. She looked at me very hard and said, \"It's 8:20.\" I was taken aback by her tone and wasn't going to split hairs, so I apologized and said \"I am really sorry, we were looking for parking for a half hour.\" She continued. \u00a0\"Well, you should have left earlier.\" I was kind of shocked- and just stared at her, then found myself apologizing profusely. I mean-- she was so pissed, and though now I see that she was out of line at that moment I just found myself practically groveling. I get her point, it's a small place, but really-- it's not like we were an hour late and if staying on schedule on Valentine's Day means that 15 minutes is a deal breaker, maybe consider hiring a valet for the night. Just one night. But then she said \"You should have planned better, I mean, are you familiar with parking in Bay Ridge? Did you think about the fact that you'd have to park? You could have called us.\" \u00a0I started to get angry. I didn't need to be reprimanded like a child, not over something like this. I stared her right in the eye and said \"In fact I am familiar, and in fact we did call you, there was no answer.\" She challenged me and said \"What number did you call?\" Feeling like a criminal, I rattled off the first six numbers and told her there was no answer. She said \"That's my cell.\" I said \"Well, I called you from whatever number you called me from today.\"She persisted, and said we should have planned better. I was really angry, and said \"Should we leave?\" She said \"Oh, no, not at all!\" changing her attitude quickly. Against my better judgment, realizing we'd never get a table anywhere on Valentine's Day and knowing how much we had looked forward to this meal, we sat down, and I tried to move past it.We waited more than a 25-min/ half hour between courses which, while excessive, I understood given the size of the place, the fact that there is one cook and it's Valentine's Day. We didn't linger over the food but I noticed that as soon as our last bite was in our mouths the plates were immediately taken away, even though we found ourselves waiting for the next course for a while. Once, during my entree, before I'd even put my fork down they had taken my plate away. It was the bum's rush.Other diners lingered, and no tables turned over during the time we were there, but it seemed like we were being rushed-- the only ones being rushed. I tried to not feel paranoid, but it got pretty obvious, maybe it was our lateness, maybe it was my standing up for myself, but though she had told us we should stay, the owner/waitress' actions showed otherwise. No other diners moved. We don't drink, but they lingered over their meals and wine without there seeming to be a problem at all. Without asking us, our check was dropped-- no \"can I get you anything else,\" nothing. I felt for sure then as I had felt all along: that being 15 minutes late had in some way taken away our right to courteous service. It was over $100 for the two of us, no alcohol. Not a cheap meal. I laid out the cash and as I stood up, the owner/waitress came over, took the check, and as I stood there putting on my coat cleared our table. I was still at it. \u00a0She didn't acknowledge me in any way, no \"Thanks guys\" as she grabbed the money or \"Have a good night\" or even an \"Excuse me\" as she edged me out of the way to lay out the new settings. I was so disappointed. I've hesitated about posting this review because I know it's a small place and I hadn't had an issue there before, but it was that kind of awful experience that ruins a place for you. A night we had been looking forward to was ruined-- because of 15 minutes-- or, more likely, because the owner/waitress was having a bad day, and we bore the brunt of it.

You'll start with a nice bread served alongside soft, salted butter (the importance of spreadable butter is often overlooked).

Petit Oven, a French/American Restaurant on Bay Ridge Avenue near 3rd Ave (in Brooklyn) may very well be the dining experience you've been waiting for. Kat (the owner and chef) is an artist in her open-air kitchen! Do not question it. Just sit back, relax and allow her to take your taste buds on a mouth-watering journey. Soft music, including some French tunes, will be the background to your conversation. Nicole, co-owner and ma\u00eetre d', will make your dining experience a pleasurable one. The courses are elegantly paced out and you have plenty of time in between them to enjoy your conversation and savor the tastes. The menu is not vast and changes monthly, but a quality peak! I would also like to add, that this wonderful little eatery will not please finicky eaters but will absolutely tantalize my fellow foodies who do not like to be bombarded with a ton of \"Can I get you anything else's\" and \"Are you doing okay's\". You will have the time to relax and slowly enjoy - much like in France.

The pictures placed around were simple and added to the feel of the place. \u00a0The chef was readily available to converse with the guests, allowing for a personal touch not found in many restaurants. \u00a0The menu was not terribly large, but that ensures that each item on it would be treated with the utmost respect and prepared deliciously, which they were. \u00a0For starters, we shared the special of the day, which was lobster and very tasty combined with the corn. \u00a0My wife ordered the duck and I ordered the wild bass. \u00a0The duck was crusted beautifully and cooked just right. \u00a0My bass was cooked slightly too long but still very delicious, as was the spinach ravioli. \u00a0As for the dessert, the very nice waitress suggested the bread pudding, which was the perfect end to the meal.Though the prices are not typical for the area, Petit Oven is one of the best restaurants you can go to. \u00a0We will definitely go again some time soon and create new experiences that we will both remember.", "Date": "2010-08-24", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Jennifer T.", "ReviewID": "6Vs3ZL-UHPRtniBVr_fbHw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I can't decide if this is truly a 'hidden gem' - while stuck on otherwise commercial Bay Ridge Ave, every time I walk by it, it's packed! So much for the better, though -- it's one of the few truly 'upscale' places in the area. The atmosphere inside is cozy and intimate (verging on uncomfortably crowded, but not quite). Service is leisurely but very friendly. We both went for the 3 course tasting menu, which looks to change weekly. Unfortunately the week we went the duck entree` wasn't on the menu, which is what I was looking forward to. The mussels appetizer was one of the better ones I've had (and I LOVE mussels) -- the broth was pefectly lush and garlicky. The roasted chicken was a bit on the salty side but not in an unappealing way, and the brussel sprouts on the side were perfect (I'd happily eat a plate of them alone). Dessert was homemade bread pudding -- you can't go wrong with that :)The open kitchen was fun to observe, and this place is truly a labor of love, so it pleases me to see it busy all the time. It's also one of the only places in the area that puts a focus on local, seasonal foods which is fantastic.

Definitely top 5 for anywhere. This is based on eating at lots of restaurants in Manhattan, DC and Boston, MANY of which were MORE expensive than Petit Oven.The food is FRESH. The ingredients are seasonal, local and FRESH. The preparation is clean (not overdone with lots of extra ingredients), creative and done to order. No pots sitting around getting old in that kitchen!And the dishes themselves are delicious! Everything is seasonal, so the menu changes all the time. My favorite was probably a sole that literally melted in my mouth. It was so tender but not because it was drowned in sauce - you could absolutely taste the fish itself and it was perfect. And their roasted or braised chicken... chicken sounds so boring, but you don't realize how good and flavorful the meat itself can be when it is raised right and sourced locally! They ask you how you want the salmon done because it is fresh enough to be cooked medium rare and taste AMAZING. I also had a cassoulet once that was delicious and hearty - perfect for cold weather.I haven't even mentioned appetizers and dessert. The eggplant napoleon is CRAZY good and the bread pudding is probably the best I've had anywhere. I always get the prix-fixe tasting menu, which is a steal at $35. It's downright absurd on Wednesdays for $25. The a la carte entrees may be bigger (and are still very reasonably priced for what you are getting), but the tasting menu entrees are just slightly less than you would expect if you were having one course. With three courses, I always leave FULL (but not unhealthy/sick feeling).Great wine list. Awesome music in the background. Intimate feel. Locally owned.

We ordered Mussels, cheese dish and potato latke for Appetzers. It was all good but the potato Latke with salmon tartar was a real standout.

But my neighbor introduced me to Petite Oven .... and can I just say .... \"Thank you Jesus!\" A lovely little farm to table nook is just what I wanted as a house warming present. The bread has a great rustic taste to it .... and yes the butter is salty smooth. And yes it's all gone before we get to order our drinks. The wine menu is wisely selected and moderate in price ... you can order a bottle or two without sacrificing the rest of your menu options. The salmon tartar on potato pancakes is suburb. The duck is oh so good and even the steak is cooked to a nice medium rare (as I requested ... Merci). The only issue I had was on Valentine's Day I dined their and half my order of mussels were either closed shut or barely open, to avoid possible food poisoning I reluctantly pushed more than half of my mussels to the side. And the seafood dish I ordered, the clams were closed and the mussels were barely open. Right beside me an elderly gentleman was trying to pry his clam open with a butter knife (I really wanted to shriek and warn him of the dangers of eating it but more of a \"please do not cut your hand off\")! \u00a0As I set aside half my dinner .... I settled into a wonderful dessert. The staff is warm and knowledgeable of the menu, I take their recommendations as genuine. I frequent here often but I personally lay off of the shellfish, I have had food poisoning before (NOT HERE!) and I would not wish it on the worst of my enemies. But do not be shy, come and see what this yummy nook has in store for you.", "Date": "2012-05-22", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Joan C.", "ReviewID": "gxdH3_n_FyXTR8m7KFNCmA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i had dinner again, tonight at what has to be the best kept secret in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. \u00a0The food is Manhattan five star restaurant quality. \u00a0The service is impeccable. They treat you like family. \u00a0Friendly and attentive, they make you feel right at home. They have a lovely wine selection and beer as well. \u00a0I had butternut squash soup that was the best I have ever had. \u00a0A rib eye steak done to perfection w/ from scratch pomme frites (french fries). \u00a0Everything is of high quality and the owners know their stuff, they only buy the finest ingredients from local markets. Presentation is beautiful. I have eaten here several times and it's consistently one of the finest meals to be had in Brooklyn. It takes a little while as Chef Kat is the only one who prepares the meals, but believe me when I tell you it's worth the wait. Parking can be a pain in Bay Ridge, but truthfully I always find a spot. Give yourself ample parking time just in case you're not as lucky as me. \u00a0All I know is I'd park on the moon and walk if I had to, the food is just that good. \u00a0But you better call for a reservation. \u00a0The place was jumping tonight and the phone kept ringing. \u00a0Absolutely fabulous!!", "Date": "2012-10-06", "Author_Location": "Staten Island, NY"}, {"Author": "Elizabeth L.", "ReviewID": "CflGWOwIMbOFflwhkOsFeQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazingly perfect every time - it's my go-to restaurant for all celebrations.", "Date": "2011-06-17", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Karolina D.", "ReviewID": "nxrPXKGU0CsZvT7jvbPSmA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This place serves very good food.

We ate here last night and were so impressed with our service, meal and the special vibe the restaurant had to offer. We made 8:45pm reservations, luckily found parking very easily at that time, and stepped into an intimate restaurant that smelled like heaven. The decor is super cute, not kitschy, very clean and giving off a very Parisian theme. \u00a0Our waitress was great, very knowledgeable about the menu and steered us in the right direction. The menu is perfection...anything you might want from duck to to steak to sweet potato gnocchi and different types of fish. The salads were divine, perfectly thought out and dressed very nicely. The wine menu is, again, fabulous, a great Pinot Noir and Bordeaux...our waitress was also extremely helpful with descriptions to help us choose a bottle that would compliment our meal. There's a half open kitchen which is fun because you can see how focused the chef's are behind the scenes. There were 2 waitresses working the dining room, both were extremely funny, sweet and attentive. We eat out often and it's always interesting to see how the staff works with (or sometimes against!) each other, and you get the sense that these people enjoy working here. Our dessert was an item listed as a special and was the perfect way to end a perfect meal. Every single item was ordered was cooked to absolute perfection and very delicious. At the end, the very kind chef came out to send us off, which was a treat considering we were witness to how hard she had worked throughout the night. This place is perfect and I can guarantee that we'll be back in the very near future! This is an absolute must on anyone's list of establishments!", "Date": "2012-02-05", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}], "RestaurantInfo": {"RestaurantID": "_k5SqIDjIKhUxv34AoxFUg", "Name": "Petit Oven", "Price": "$$$", "RestaurantURL": "/biz/petit-oven-brooklyn", "Longitude": " -74.02648200000000", "Address": "276 Bay Ridge AveBrooklyn, NY 11220", "Latitude": " 40.635817000000003", "ImgURL": "//s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oc5_KNekh8dSIFQHI0HTtQ/90s.jpg"}}
