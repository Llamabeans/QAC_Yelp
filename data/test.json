I had to hide my surprise that it was modern looking and clean. There was a menu of boba-style drinks on the wall as well. There is limited seating. It's that rare hole-in-the-wall place that actually cares for appearances!With check-in (at the time) there were a couple of free egg rolls. This is nice. Crispy without being burned. The contents were a little mysterious but far from skimpy.Things!- Spicy lemongrass chicken. A generous pile of white meat chicken in a lemongrass sauce, served with a side of rice and a couple slices of cucumber. Simple and delicious! Unlike a lot of things that say \"lemongrass,\" this had very distinct flavor in it without being overbearing. You'll want to mash the rice right in there to soak it all up.- Rare beef pho. I'm not even a pho lover and I was instantly a fan. Something about the broth was appealing to me over other places I've been to. The beef was tender. Everything else was as you'd expect. I'm not going to pick this apart anymore because I don't know what else I'm talking about.- Black sesame and avocado smoothie. I've had similar to this before but the version here was even better! Creamy and not to sweet (though that's likely because I asked for it to be that way). A little mismatched with the rest of the meal but... whatever!For my next Viet craving, this is definitely my go-to spot now... and it's open late!", "Date": "2014-07-20", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Monica S.", "ReviewID": "s0ej25qLkoq9Kc7AKIX9Gg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had pho two times and it has been good, much better than last year.

I've been going here an embarrassingly amount of times per week for the past year and I guess I'm too busy wolfing down food to write a review. I'd consider myself a pho connoisseur and I can say without a doubt, best pho in Vegas. Well best pho broth in Vegas. I always get the veggie pho. I'm far from a vegetarian I just don't like meat swimming \u00a0in my soup. I'm a big fan of their other items- favorites are their shrimp papaya salad (BEST I've ever had outside of Thailand), house friend rice with scrumptious Chinese sausage and shrimp, the shaking beef melts in your mouth, beef wrap shrimp are better than Christmas morning and their egg rolls. OhThose egg rolls. If I were to find out the filling was in fact not pork, but old tires and rat feet, I would still gladly inhale them. Their vermicelli with pork, pork skin and shrimp is also delectable. I dump coconutCream on top to make it a real party . Very cute inside after the recent remodel. The staff is very friendly and kind. They know me by my voice when I call to get to go which is great and embarrassing.

When I first moved here to Las Vegas, after driving for 3 days and over 2000 miles, Da Lat was the first restaurant I ever ate at in this fare city. I thought it was one of the best pho's I've ever had, and ever since then, it has always been in my top 3.Over the next several years, I've had the opportunity to come back here on several occasions. The Vietnamese crepe, bun bo hue, and every other items that I've tried were some of the best that I've ever had!Well, I came here the other day wanting to recreate some of my past experiences here. I noticed on yelp that they have new hours, and they are open until 4am, when they used to close a lot earlier. And I came in at 2am. When I walked in, I noticed that they had done a complete makeover of the place. It had turned into a more sleek and modern vibe, rather than the previous mom n' pop feel. The waiter told me that even though the restaurant went through a renovation, the owners are still the same owners.After scanning their menu I noticed that the prices are still the same, which is good because I thought Da Lat always gave great value for what you got. But, it looks like they have taken their awesome crepe off the menu.. Darn!! So I decided to go with the pho.Combo beef pho - the broth is still as good as I remember, you can taste the beef flavor as well as the spices commonly used in a good broth. The meatballs and brisket was good and plentiful. I can't remember if there is any rare beef that is supposed to come with the combo, but I didn't receive any and I don't have a menu with me to check.So here is the big reason that this is not a 5 star review. They brought out the traditional accompaniments for the pho; bean sprouts, Thai basil, and sliced jalape\u00f1os. The bean sprouts were turning brown, limp, slightly slimy and smelled off. The basil was dried up. And, the jalape\u00f1os had a dried up as well, noticing the white on the outside. I made the mistake of adding these items to my great soup, and it ruined everything. I've never had this problem before, but I usually have come in at earlier times, when the husband and wife are in the kitchen...I would come back here, but probably at an earlier time. I don't know who is working the menu at late-night, but they need to be trained on what is acceptable and not acceptable to send out to the customers. Oh, and bring back the crepe!!", "Date": "2014-06-16", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Quang H.", "ReviewID": "va7W0Qo_hyTZdiJKnJUgMA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "They are closed for remodeling and reopen back on Saturday June 7th at 11am...

The broth was just okay, the noodles a bit too soft for me as my chop sticks were breaking them too easily, well done brisket is okay for me, but the BF least favorite thing so he just ate noodles and I ate some of the meat. BBQ pork rice with casserole and shredded pork - they ended up giving me BBQ pork with eggrolls and shrimp instead.

It doesnt compare to the OC/Westminster/Garden Grove money-proportion, but for Vegas, it was pretty good. The food was delicious, didnt seem like it had too much MSG (usually i knock out from food coma after a bowl). The soup wasnt too heavy, and the noodles werent too soft and mushy. My favorite part of the bowl was the meat...the meat tasted especially good here for some reason. Even though I only had one bowl, when I really wanted 2, this place is my favorite so far in Las Vegas, Nevada.Great Service, the lady who worked at the cash register even told me that a lot of customers found out about this place from yelp.UNTIL THEN!! ^-^", "Date": "2010-09-06", "Author_Location": "Irvine, CA"}, {"Author": "Neal E.", "ReviewID": "gKK1G7QJ0ZdYb09iXulxFw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been over a year and a half since my last business trip to Vegas.

The perfect hangover cure, I thought!So on Saturday morning, after a night of boozing and schmoozing, my friends and I hopped in my car and drove the 3 miles to Da Lat expecting a refreshing bowl of noodle soup. One of my friends opted for the Subway next door and brought her foot long club sandwich over to Da Lat to join us. She had finished it before we even received our Pho.Reviews on here made it sound like a crazy, busy place so I was worried that we would have to wait in line forever. Luckily, when we arrived it was nearly empty except for one group of 8. We sat down and a very nice, young, teenage girl took our drink orders. She returned quickly with our drinks and took our food orders.We ordered fresh spring rolls to share, fried rice to share and each of us ordered a large bowl of Pho. I also ordered an iced Thai tea. The tea and spring rolls arrived quickly. The tea had a funny taste (more than usual) so I only choked down half of it. The spring rolls were delicious and very fresh. We devoured them. Then the fried rice came out and I took a chance and ate it. I didn't feel sick afterward so it must be GF safe. The rice was VERY salty and greasy. Good fried rice will always be greasy but it doesn't have to be salty. On the plus side, it was loaded with different veggies and meats. The salty rice filled us up and we were slowing down and getting tired by the time our Pho arrived.My friend's Pho arrived about 5 minutes prior to mine. Presumably because my broth had to be hotter for the rare beef. The bowls were MASSIVE. I always order the biggest Pho a place has, but these were just crazy. Each of us finished about 1/8 of it before the salt caught up to us. The add-ins that were given weren't as varied or abundant as many places I have been, but they still did the job. The broth was probably the oiliest I have ever had. The entire surface was covered in oil droplets. Not appetizing. Regardless of its appearance, it still hit the spot and we went home for our MSG induced nap. I awoke and ate the remainder of my Pho. Somehow it was better at room temperature. I am not giving this place 5 stars because the teenage girls who served us did not wear their hair in ponytails and it looked like they had just rolled out of bed. I understand that it is a small, family restaurant but a little bit of hygiene goes a long way. I don't want to think about hair flipping in my food every time I watch the server rush back to the kitchen.

Served alongside were garnishes of Jalapeno Peppers, Bean Sprouts, Thai Basil & Lime. The flavors were smoky, beefy, and rich. This Pho was absolutlely stellar.Com Bo Cuon Tom (Shrimp Wrapped In Beef) - An elegant and delicous little Vietnamese Surf & Turf combo served w/ steamed White Rice, Cucumbers, Tomatoes & Lettuce.Everything we ordered was at least very, very good while the Pho Dac Biet and Banh Xeo were amazing.

NO YOU DON'T! Needless to say, I got my table. We sat down and I told the waitress that we didn't need the menu as we already know what we want. She replies, \"you still have to wait\", and walks away. 10minutes later, she comes back to take our order. So it took 20minutes for two pho sate and one mien ga (clear noodle chicken soup) to come. It took 30 minutes for a pho combination to come!!!! I've NEVER waited more than 10minutes for a pho. The porportions have shrunk, the food saltier and more oily. Found some bugs in my soup too. \u00a0the chicken in my clear noodle chicken soup was so tough--worst than jerky (like it's been refridgerated for weeks). The mints for the pho were all wilted (like reused veggies),While we were waiting, I was able to witness how inefficient and unsanitary these people were. the waitress at the counter (the same who took our order) was preparing ice water--She actually stuck her entire hand into a pitcher of water to remove a big junk of ice. Then when she poured some ice on the counter, she picked it up with her hands and placed it back into the pitcher. GROSS! Then we witnessed a mother and son party come in, they waited 15minutes, but instead of sitting them when a table was ready, they sat a table of 3 that just came in. The mother and son approached them and all they said was sorry, can you wait a little longer??? When she got piss and left, they just smiled and said, \"have a nice day\". Idiots!Is it so hard to have a waiting list? They had plenty of cooks in the kitchen, why did it take forever for the food to come (it's not even cuisine food!) The food has declined drastically and the portion shrunken, not to mention how unsanitary things are. The service is SLOWER than before--there is absolutely no organization.
